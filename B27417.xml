            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT pious and devout Priest old <hi>Zachary,</hi> who walked in all the Commandments of the Lord blameless, being to be the Father of the Voice <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> was for his infidelity for seven moneths at least struck dumb; neither was the benefit of his tongue restored, till he made signs for writing Tables, and wrote in them, that Word of Grace, <hi>His Name shall be called John,</hi> a man who was to be the voice of the Cryer, and first to proclaim the glad tydings of the Gospel. Some such thing hath been imposed upon me for more than these seven years, so that rarely I have in Publick been permitted to speak, and proclaim those glad tydings, which were put into my mouth. In which my case is yet somewhat different from that old Priest: For his tongue was tied up for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, mine is restrained for my fidelity; his because he believed not, mine because I do believe, and testifie to the world that those things I do believe are true. A draught whereof your Honour shall see fully delineated in these Sermons.</p>
            <p>For to be silent alwayes, was pain and grief to me; and while I
<pb facs="tcp:200414:3"/> was thus musing, I called for writing Tables, and spake thus with my pen, no other thing than what I before spake with my Tongue. And if pen and tongue offend too, then I am in a great strait, and know not how to proclaim the Gospel: To which Office yet I am called, and I tremble at the Apostles <hi>Vae, Wo is me If I preach not the Gospel;</hi> and I shake at that fearful commination in the Prophet: <hi>If the Watchman see the sword come, and not blow the Trumpet, and the people be not warned, if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity: But his blood will I require at the Watchmans hand. Nunquid ego scripsi? nunquid delere possum?</hi> Did I write these words? can I blot them out? If any other man dare do it, I submit and yield to be silent and silenced; otherwise I must speak. Speak what I may not in the Pulpit, yet in the Press.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To</hi> this I have been some years since earnestly pressed by learned friends, even when times were calm, and the Church at Unity. But I profess I was deaf to the motion, being conscious to my own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and insufficiency, esteeming my self unworthy to appear before the eyes of a learned and judicious Clergy.</p>
            <p>But now at last I am provoked by the reproaches cast upon the silent and silenced Ministers by a scurrilous and factious generation; who notwithstanding the Ordinance against ejected Ministers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach our silence, and object our fear: as if there were no way to contend for the truth once delivered to the Saints, and but once, and to proclaim to the Gospel, but to step into the Pulpit, and preach, and to oppose and contradict the Edicts of those in power. A grave Divine hath well observed, that this their heat ariseth not out of any affection they bear to the Glory of God, the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Gospel, or the salvation of the people: But because they have declared their Malignity and Inconformity to the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they are sorry they can have no more company. To stop the mouths of these, my Apology shall be the same, which that great and Learned Dr. <hi>Reinolds</hi> made, when he was in our case, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelizo manu &amp; scriptione.</hi> And this I profess was one reason, which hastned to light this Edition.</p>
            <p>But another there was, which in time preceded this. It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to your Lordship, that I have exposed to the Publick view an Exposition of the Church-Catechism, and composed it with what Brevity and perspicuity I could. To dilate upon the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Religion, was not proper for such a Breviary, which yet to be more fully unfolded I held it necessary. These Depths especially lie couched in the Creed, and that they might be more fully known, I set my self upon this work, contriving my Meditations into Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, because men nowadayes are fallen into adoration: These now no less being made an Idol, then the old Liturgy.</p>
            <p>At your Lordships being in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> I assure my self you could not be unacquainted with the common proverb, <hi>Quien mal en h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rna, saca los panes tuertos, i. e.</hi> He that sets his bread ill into
<pb facs="tcp:200414:3"/> the Oven, shall have wry-mouth'd loaves. <hi>A</hi> care then must be taken in the moulding and making up the bread, and preparing it for the Oven, or else the batch will run all a-wry. This diligence I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire may be taken about the bread of life, which while it hath been over-leaven'd and kneaded, and set into the Oven by unskilful hands, the loaves have run all awry, and become so deformed and pouch-mouthd as we see at this day. VVhat is already ill-mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hard-baked, and mishaped, cannot be new-formed; but the way to hinder this distortion for the future, is to lay the foundation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon such grounds: as will bear up the structure. For then the Fabrick will neither shoot too far on one side or the other, but will keep that even and comely proportion that it ought. Now a better way to compass this cannot be imagined, than by acquainting our selves clearly and foundly with the Contents of our Christian Faith. These are Principles of great amplitude; Every Article containing in the belly of it a Mine of Mysteries, which in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath swoln into that bulk that here you behold.</p>
            <p>Before I fell upon the main work it self, I held it Necessary that my Auditory should be well inform'd and seasoned with the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Religion, that good part which <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> chose. To which, Infidelity and hardness of heart <hi>ex diametro</hi> are such apparent adversaries, that I conceived it was requisite to remove these first, and that which strongly bewitcheth and draws to these, <hi>viz.</hi> too much carefulness and Anxiety of earthly things, before I proposed the Object of Belief. For he who with <hi>Martha</hi> is distracted or <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about many things,</hi> or carries in his bosom an heart of unbelief, or hath a soul hardned with the deceitfulness of sin, will never with comfort and affection profess <hi>Credo in Deum, &amp;c.</hi> will never with <hi>Mary</hi> make choice of that <hi>good part which shall never be taken away.</hi> My intent and labour hath been in the five first Sermons to remove these impediments; And I hope it will no more offend any man, that I have premised these Meditations, then it would a Traveller to find all rubs and stumbling blocks taken out of his way, that he may arrive at his journies end with the greater ease.</p>
            <p>In the tract it self, if your Lordship meet not with the same even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and easiness of expression, it must be imputed to the Subject Matter, since all the contents are not of an equal clearness. Some Articles are of such a Bottomless Depth, that we must be content to measure them with such plummets as we may and is lawful.</p>
            <q>Ornari res ipsa negat, contenta doceri.</q>
            <p>Others are again accommodated to our understanding, and nearer unto reason; and these I have illustrated with such helps as Arts could teach: VVhich (let mens fancies suggest what they please) I by long experience know, that they are very necessary and instrumental for a Divine, and I bless God that I was brought up in them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:200414:4"/>
            <p>That I have devoted this my labour to your Honours service, need be no wonder, since it is well known your Honour drew me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these parts, in which I have lived so many, and breathed only these last years. VVhen therefore your Honour hath always had so great an Interest in the Author, 'tis but just you have also an Interest in his endeavours. The seeds of these were first sown in you and other hopeful fresh earth at <hi>Croydon,</hi> which there was committed to my husbandry; they ripened in this air, and your Honour was often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Harvest of them, when you were pleased to bind up the handfuls with the best attention. And therefore I shall the less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of your kind reception, when you may review, turn them into good bread, and digest them at your leasure.</p>
            <p>The first of these is more properly due to your Honourable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to her piety I devote it, being one of the first Sermons she heard in these parts. And it seems her Honour heard it to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, in whom the vertues of the two Sisters <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> are so happily combin'd.</p>
            <p>My Lord, it is your happiness to have a Lady brought by God to you extracted out of two most Noble and Illustrious families, to be what God created a woman, a help meet for you. Your loves are equal, your cares are equal, and that your pieties and devotions may be equal, I have presented to your Honours these my conceptions, which if your Honours be pleased to accept with a candid aspect, you shall bind me to be</p>

               <hi>Who can finde a vertuous woman?</hi> His meaning is not but such an one may be found, but that there is difficulty in it; and when found, then her price is far above Rubies; two of which pearls yet we here meet with under one and the same roof, <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A pair of Sisters both from the same womb, but not of the same temper; the one <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a stirring good Huswife, a quality very commendable in the eyes of men; the other <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, now a devout, Votary, a vertue more acceptable in the eye of God; the one neither sparing care nor cost, <hi>ut pasce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Dominum,</hi> that she might feed her Lord; the other laying hold of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion <hi>ut pasceretur à Domino,</hi> that she might be fed by her Lord; the one setting her fingers to prepare and dish out the meat; the other prepared, and lending her ear to receive and feed on Christs words.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Martha</hi> takes ill, and in some discontent complains, not of her Sister alone, but by the by on Christ that suffered it; <hi>Master dost thou not care?</hi> No
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:200414:7"/> care at all good Master, that my Sister is <hi>Otiosa,</hi> sits here, and takes her ease at thy feet, while I am <hi>Negotiosa,</hi> cumbred about much serving? out of meer pitty bid her help me; she may lend her ear to the Sermon at another time.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour being willing to cool this sudden heat, and compose the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as an Advocate, enters a plea or an apology for <hi>Mary:</hi> The sum whereof is, that
<list>
                  <item>1. What she did was needful.</item>
                  <item>2. That her choise was Good.</item>
                  <item>3. That what she chose would remain.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And how full this Plea is, will more evidently appear by the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or opposition, by which the answer is illustrated and amplified; the advantage still resting on <hi>Maries</hi> side.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Martha</hi> had many things to do; <hi>Mary</hi> but one.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Martha's</hi> many things brought upon her many cares, many troubles; <hi>Maries</hi> one rest and ease: <hi>she sate at Christs-feet;</hi> a position of those who are at rest.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Martha's</hi> many but occasional; <hi>Maries</hi> necessary both for her, and her Sister. <hi>One thing is needful.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>Martha's</hi> many, in time and place, both convenient and useful; but <hi>Maries</hi> one, positively and absolutely good: <hi>A good part.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. <hi>Martha's</hi> many, transitory, that would perish and quickly fade; but <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of a lasting nature, and eternal continuance. <hi>A part that shall never be taken away from her.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>You perceive by this time the sum and occasion of these words. The Lessons to be learned hence are these.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That things well done may be ill taken.</hi> Even <hi>Maries</hi> sitting at Christs feet, and hearing his words is subject to a bad construction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That when this falls out, we be not discouraged but leave it to Christ to make the answer.</hi> Excusatur Maria, sedebat secura.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>Thirdly, In that this answer of our Saviours stands upon two feet, <hi>Laus &amp; vituperium;</hi> is partly a reprehension, partly a commendation: It may teach us, <hi>That in Christians possible it is to meet what is worthy of praise, what of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To be sollicitous, to be troubled, to be troubled about many things, is a fault and deserves a check.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To make choice of that one, good, necessary, enduring substance [Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion I mean] is true wisdom, and very commendable.</p>
            <p>But before I enter upon the words, necessary it is that we cast our eyes back upon <hi>Maries</hi> fact, or supposed fault; for such <hi>Martha</hi> conceived it to be; The complaint was
<q>That she sate at Christs feet, and heard his words, <bibl>
                     <hi>Vers. 39.</hi>
                  </bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Fathers with one consent have presented <hi>Mary</hi> to us as a type of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Christian; in whom they require two especial qualities, <hi>Humility,</hi> and an <hi>Even Soul;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 40.6.</note> to both which yet there must precede <hi>Auris perforata,</hi> the <hi>bored and open Ear,</hi> prepared to be attentive, what God shall say concerning us. These three we find conjoyn'd in <hi>Mary,</hi> an <hi>humble Spirit,</hi> a <hi>quiet Mind,</hi> and an <hi>open Ear</hi> ready to learn her lesson from Christs mouth: Her Seat was an argument of her even composed spirit; for we say, Sit down and rest: The place she took, his feet, of her humility: The loan and bend of her ear, of her obedient attention, with which she drunk in those mellifluous words that dropt from his lips.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:200414:7"/>
            <p>And yet this devout Soul could not escape the envy, murmur, nor censure of her Sister: A complaint we finde put up here against her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quicquid est pulchrum sequitur Momus.</hi> 'Tis the fate of the choicest beauties to be, though chaste, suspected, and of the delicatest blossoms to be nipt by an unkind frost: And this is the hap that befals the most conscientious of Gods Servants, to have their best deeds blasted with some unkinde breath; and their honest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions traduced by some sinister construction. Be the thing never so good in it self, or done never to so good an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, yet ill-will will fasten a rusty tooth in it, that it may rankle at least into a scar or deformity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charon</hi> in <hi>Lucian</hi> was conducted by <hi>Mercury</hi> to a place whence he might see all the world at once, and being asked by the god what he had observed, he wittily answered, <hi>That the Cities of the world seemed to him like so many Bee-hives, and the People as so many Bees, of which every one had his weapon, and that they did nothing but quarrel and sting one another.</hi> Of which sting, not any one feels the point and venome more, than the best of men: Grand offences slide by unobserved, while that which is commendable in heaven, is planet-struck on earth.</p>
            <p>Who could conceive that any man could be so envious, as to pick a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with a brother for serving his God? and yet this was the ground of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred that <hi>Cain</hi> bore to innocent <hi>Abel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4.4, 5.</note> That fire fell from heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the Sacrifice; that thereby God testified his acceptance of it; that <hi>Cain</hi>'s offering was rejected was no fault of <hi>Abels,</hi> it lay not in his power either to endear his own, or to bring dis-esteem to his brothers gift; and yet the flame of anger that arose from hence was so great that, it could be quenched with no other stream than that of blood, the blood of a brother, the blood of a pious, innocent brother.</p>
            <p>The Courtiers at <hi>Babylon</hi> were angry with <hi>Daniel;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 6.4, 5.</note> resolved they were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to remove or destroy him; this put them to pry into his actions; but so faithful they found him in what he was intrusted, that it was not possible for ill-will it self to pick occasion or fault against him: Rather than fail of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, his piety and devotion shall be brought against him; crime enough it shall prove to cast him into the Lions den, that he makes his petition to God three times a day.</p>
            <p>Dead flies cause the oyntment of the Apothecary to send forth a stinking sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;<note place="margin">Eccles. 10.1.</note> and male-content apprehensions will fly-blow the sweetest graces and performances. And of this, no one of Gods devoted had more lamentable experience than this poor woman: At three several times she shews three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral vertues, and for these three she is three times repined at.</p>
            <p n="1">1. At <hi>Simons</hi> house, she testifies her repentance with a flood of salt tears,<note place="margin">Luke 7.39.</note> and the Pharisee did what he could to disgrace her.</p>
            <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Mark 14.3, 4.</note> Not long before our Saviours death she shews her love and bountiful heart, brings her box of Spicknard, breaks it and anoints Christ's head; yet some there were that disdained, grudged at it, and molested her; <hi>To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is this waste?</hi> saith <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In this place she manifests her devotion by sitting at Christs feet, and hearing him preach; and <hi>Martha</hi> her own sister brings a complaint against her. Poor soul! nothing that she can do can give content; nor her tears, not her love, nor her box, nor her thanks, nor her bounty, nor her devotion can please all; something is still awry in their conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, or as it should not be.</p>
            <p>A foul disheartning this, and enough to cool any good and pious duty in her and in us too,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.8.</note> were it not that our way lyes to heaven <hi>through honor and dishonor;</hi> were it not <hi>by good report and bad report</hi> we are necessitated to enter thither. In a word, were it not that we had an Advocate to speak for us; the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:200414:8"/> self-same that <hi>Mary</hi> had. Be it a Pharisee, be it a <hi>Judas,</hi> be it a Sister that will repine and traduce what's well; yet we serve a good Lord that will justifie and answer for us. So he did for her here, and so he will do for her and his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <q>Jesus answered and said.</q>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Bern. Ser. <hi>3.</hi> de Assump.</note>Behold <hi>Maries</hi> prerogative: The straitlaced Pharisee grumbles at her; Christs own Disciples molest her; now her own sister <hi>Martha</hi> steps up with a complaint against her.<note place="margin">Plaut.</note>
               <hi>Ʋbi{que} Maria tacet, &amp; pro ea loquitur Christus; Mary is at all silent, but Christ speaks for her:</hi> He was <hi>Invocatus,</hi> invited for a guest, but he becomes <hi>Advocatus,</hi> an Advocate to plead for her against her querulous Sister. The elder appeals to him as to a Judge, <hi>at ex judice fit advocatus; Of a Judge he becomes an Advocate,</hi> and enters a plea for the younger.</p>
            <p>By this he give an essay what he would be for all his at the great Tribunal; appear, intercede, and speak for us, when we think not of it. <hi>Does any man sin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1.</note> and yet with <hi>Mary</hi> grieve, and mourn, and weep for that sin? the comfort is, <hi>he hath an Advocate, Jesus Christ the righteous,</hi> one <hi>at the right hand of God to make intercession:</hi> And when the case is not so good, that it for it self can be justified, upon our repentance and reliance on him, he will blot out the imperfection and guilt with his own blood. This is the answer our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate will make for us in a tolerable case. But when the action is good and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable, such as <hi>Maries</hi> was, never let the venome of an ill tongue discourage any;<note place="margin">Matth. 10.19.</note> in such a case <hi>take no thought what to answer;</hi> for an Advocate we have in the presence of that great Judge of quick and dead, and our cause can take no harm;<note place="margin">Exod. 14.14.</note> he that here answered for <hi>Mary,</hi> will then answer for you, hold you your peace. And so I come to the answer he made, and first in relation to <hi>Martha,</hi> or as it was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Reprehension.</p>

            <p n="1">1. That whereas there is One thing more needful than all the rest, she by setting her minde on <hi>Multa, many things,</hi> was too cold in the pursuit of that One.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then that whereas she might have been contented with less, she was over-careful, even to distraction in the provision of more. Her judgement in preferring earthly food before heavenly; and her care and distraction about that was ill taken.</p>
            <p>Two things we are to learn from hence.</p>
            <p>First, The one commanded, and to be supposed in the Text; <hi>viz.</hi> dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:200414:8"/> in the works of our vocation; for this is well enough compatible with Religion; nay very often commanded and practised in Scripture by the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Gods command is, <hi>in the sweat of thy brows thou shalt eat thy bread;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.

               <p>That which first commends Christian Religion is the Unity; for so indeed it is in it self but One; it was taught by One and the same God; it proposes One and the same Christ; It is inspired by One and the same Spirit; It unites all the parts under One and the same Head; it conveys all Promises under One and the same Seals; the Duties that it enjoyns are the self same; the Articles agreed upon for belief the very same; the Petitions all men are to present must be framed by One and the same pattern; the hope of our calling One and the same; And is it then possible that the Religion should be other than One, that hath so many bands of Unity?</p>
               <p>The divisions that are about it, proceed from the hot brains of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or Irreligious rather, while every one will bring his single stone, and grow cholerick, if it be not put into the foundation, which God never intended should come there.

               <p>Never instance in infinite Conclusions, some more plainly, some more obscurely hid in the bosom, and rationally deduced from the first principles; for how true, or like truth soever they are, yet they come in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Superstructures, not Foundations.

Could men be brought to be of a meek and quiet spirit, the disquisitions of these might be of great use.

               <p n="1">1. To remove that offence which most take at the dissentions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and by the Contenders Quarrels take occasion to dis-esteem the Truth. <hi>Vellem fieri Christianus, sed nescio cui parti adhaream,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

It falls not so out in other Professions; why then in this? The Lawyers contend, and yet the Law is honour'd; Physicians differ in opinion, and yet Physique is in request; Though then Divines are at odds, yet let not Religion fare the worse. Honour the mother, howsoever the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be ungracious, and quarrelsome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in the midst of these disputes adhere to those Truths which all Christians hold. For there is one Old safe way, whereof all Christians are agreed in this world of Cavils. A way that lies faire enough, and is plaine enough to heaven; and there needed nor so much complaint, were not men more desirous to walk in Mazes of their own, than in this one Way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What doubts may happen about those things which lie by the way side; wisdome it were that every one would not be too busie about them; or at least so busie as to make a rent in the Church for them. For Schisme and separation may cast away that soul, whom simple ignorance and errour shall not.</p>
               <p>Two Doctors of Physique sate at a Table together,<note place="margin">Dallingt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor.</note> and a third man at the same board, who wanted their learning, but had a better stomach than either to his meat. The one of these was a <hi>Gallenist,</hi> the other a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsian,</hi> of different opinions both; and as it falls out, in the midst of din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they fall to Argument. The <hi>Gallenist</hi> speaks highly and eagerly for his simples, the <hi>Paracelsian</hi> for his Spirits, and opposed whatsoever was said, more out of spleen, and a humour of contention, than that the truth was on his side. At last from arguing, these two sticklers fall to rayling, to fretting, to open defiance. Choler so increased in the one, and melancholy in the other, and the blood so inflamed in both, that the digestion being hindered, they were both taken away desperately sick. But the poor honest <hi>Ignaro,</hi> that sate by all this while, who understood not the cause, though he heard the Quarrel, fell heartily to his meat, while they fell by the ears;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:200414:11"/> at last he arose, gave God thanks, digested it well, and in the strength of that meat, went on to his honest labour, and at evening receiv'd his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Thus it fares with the Rabbins in Divinity, and the simple honest Christian. They may disputs themselves sick, and so lose the benefit of the sweet and <hi>sincere milk of the Word;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.2.</note> while the meek and quiet soul, that knows as much as needs only, may sit and feed, and bless God for his whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some meat, and by it be nourished up to eternal life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, It were to be wished, that men were not so, not to set up Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar against Altar, Faith against Faith, one kinde of service against another. Charity may compound, at least tolerate unnecessary differences. It savors not of a Gospel-spirit, to fasten the name of Anti-Christian and Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on that they like not, and presently to unsaint that man who is not of their judgement. Unity well beseems those who serve the Prince of Peace.</p>
               <p>Hearty reverence, and devout adoration are for holy Mysteries; much wrangling and prating never was, nor will be the Character of a devout soul. It is not the cunning pate, but the honest heart that God accepts. God had not such a Servant in the earth as <hi>Job;</hi>

All Arts have their <hi>Arcana,</hi> secrets; Religion its <hi>Mysteria,</hi> mysteries; and it is not the over-curious search of these will bring you to heaven. In a word, I will shew you a plaine way, a brief way, and a safe way. The belief of what is delivered in the Apostles Creed: The practice of what God requires in the Decalogue: and the commencing your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and prayers in and after that forme that Christ hath caught, is the easie and ready path that leads to heaven.</p>
               <p>Let then your study be to know this Rule, let your endeavour be to walk aright in this path, keep this one way, <hi>minde this same thing,</hi> and you shall be happy. And if any man, in the Conclusions deduced from these, be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise minded,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.16.</note> let him propose his Scruples, <hi>sedatè,</hi> in a milde, and an humble way, and never trouble the Church. Witty men may pretend the pursuit of Truth so long as they please; but I shall never believe any man to do this sincerely, who is not of a meek and a quiet spirit; for <hi>hostis est veritatis, quisquis non est amicus unitatis,</hi> he is an enemy to Truth, who is not a friend of unity.</p>
               <p>Christ in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> professeth that he received a wound from his Spouse,<note place="margin">Cant. 4.9.</note> but it was from a single and united eye, from a twisted or united lock, or wreath. Thou hast ravished, or taken away, <hi>or wounded my heart, my Sister, my Spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thy eyes, with one chaine of thy neck.</hi> These eyes, these chaines, these wreaths, are the operations of a Christian soul, and they wound not, they ravish not till they be united, till they knit together in Charity, which is the Bond of perfection.</p>
               <p>Faith indeed wounds and ravisheth the heart of Christ, but it is that faith that works by love. Hope wounds also, but it must go hand in hand with Charity. Devotion and prayer draws his eye, but never till it be united with goodwill. Obedience <hi>rapit ad se,</hi> take away his bowels and heart, but it must be then the obedience of Love.</p>
               <p>Love it is that does all, makes all one; two eyes, one eye; many sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle haires, one lock; which if you remove, nor Faith, nor Knowledge, nor, Hope, nor Devotion, nor Obedience, nor any other eminent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, will ever ravish the heart of your heavenly Spouse.</p>
               <p>Charity it is that will unite you to God, and God to you. Charity it is that of many will make one; Make men to be of one mind in an house,

                  <hi>and one soul;</hi> which is the property of that Religion which I have hitherto shew'd you to be but One.</p>
               <p>Next I am to prove, that this <hi>one thing</hi> is <hi>Necessary;</hi> for that's the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of our Saviours Proposition.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> One thing is Needful: or as the Vulgar, Necessary; as <hi>Tremel.</hi> Requisite.</head>
               <p>To tell some that <hi>Maries</hi> part was that good part; or others, that it is a lasting part, such as will hold out, when other things will part with us, will prove but weak Arguments. For some are so wicked, that they regard not what is good; and others so worldly, that they are all for the present. If it appeare then that this is requisite, needful, necessary; that without it, <hi>nec esse potest,</hi> that without it a man cannot be what he should be, what he desires to be, <hi>viz.</hi> Happy; then I dare say there cannot be a more powerful reason to perswade.</p>
               <p>Now a thing is sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to be necessary two wayes. 1. <hi>Ad esse rei.</hi> 2. <hi>Ad operari.</hi> Either to the being and constitution of a thing, or else to its actions and operations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An essence or being every mam hath, <hi>esse naturae,</hi> for he is a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal creature; and I say not that Religion is necessary to make him a man; for how many men are there, who are not, nor will be perswaded to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious? who yet do participate of reason, and have a humane being. A man then may be a man without it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But there is another <hi>Esse,</hi> or being, an <hi>esse gratiae,</hi> a being that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from grace, that raiseth a man to a higher pitch, restores him to that Image in which he was at first <hi>created;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3.10. 1 Pet. 1.4.</note> makes him <hi>partaker of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> walking here below as a kinde of mortal God. Now to give a man such an Essence, Religion is necessary; yea, and this part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which <hi>Mary</hi> here chose and practised.</p>
               <p>Every thing before it have a being, must have a Procreant cause. In this, the Seed and Original of our being <hi>is the Word;</hi> to heare which,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.26. 1 Cor. 4.15. 1 Cor. 3.2. Heb. 5.14.</note>
                  <hi>Mary</hi> sate at Christs feet, whose place now the Pastour supplies; <hi>I have begotten you through the Gospel.</hi> And after any thing is brought forth, it must be brought up to, and have nourishment; the Word of God is this also; <hi>Milk to the babe, meat to the strong men.</hi> Farther yet, both children and men have need of <hi>Doctrine, Reproof, Correction, Instruction.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16, 17</note> The most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous soul, at one time or other, will stand in need of one or more of these; and to this, this one thing is requisite, for it makes the man of God perfect. Denied then it cannot be, but the Principles of Religion are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to make and constitute a man of grace, and of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I come in the next place to his actions and operations, these must be consonant to his being. For such as any thing is in its being, such also it will shew it self by working; The Sun will shew it self to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of light, by illuminating, and a Tree to be of this or that kinde by the fruit. Actions are required of the Religious, for they must be doers;<note place="margin">Isa. 1.22. John 15.2.</note> fruits, for to that end they were emplanted in the Vine; now no action can be compleat, no fruit good for the object, for the end, for the cause, for all requisite conditions, except Religion conducts it; and therefore the Rules of Religion are necessary <hi>ad operari</hi> also.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Adams</hi> fall, this rule of our Actions, was very much obscured in the soul and faculties. Men did what they could to null it. It was against their lusts, and therefore they threw it aside. Then came also a super-seminator,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:200414:12"/> that <hi>enemy,</hi> that sowed his Tares in the heart; The rankest of which was, <hi>Bonum est quod prodest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 13.28.</note> That alone is good, which is profitable; and what is profitable, is good.</p>
               <p>Therefore God was pleased to write it fair again; not in two Tables of stone,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.3. Jer. 32.40.</note> as on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but in the fleshly Tables of <hi>the heart, that they depart not from him.</hi> This will direct us in all goodness, to all we are to do, to God,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.12.</note> to man, to our selves. 1. To God, that we live piously, adore him reverently, constantly, sincerely. 2. To man, that we carry our selves justly, charitably. <hi>Fac, quod potes,</hi> is the counsel of <hi>Machiavel. Fac, quod vis pati,</hi> Do as thou wouldst be done to, is the rule of Truth. 3. To our selves,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.32. Luke 12.19.</note> soberly. Our sensual part will cast no Bridle upon our lust. Ask na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and it whispers, <hi>Ede, bibe, lude, Soul, take thy ease, eat, drinks, and be merry.</hi> Take God for thy Counsellour, and he will set a restraint upon all excess. Reason we have common with Angels, sense with Beasts; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will teach us, <hi>ut quod deterius subjiciatur meliori,</hi> The worst part be subject to the better; that reason be subject to God, sense to reason.</p>
               <p>If then we intend that our actions adorne our profession, necessary it is that we be skilful in this one Rule, since this must direct the understanding to know every duty perfectly; the judgement to discern betwixt good and evil exactly; the memory to retain what is taught firmly; the will to choose the better, and leave the worst freely; and the affections to love what God loves, and hate what he hates ardently.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 12.12.</note>
                  <hi>It is to no end</hi> (saith the Wise man) <hi>to make many books,</hi> and 'tis to no end <hi>to use many words;</hi> will you hear the Conclusion of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that necessary point we must all drive at? To feare God, and keep his Commandments, is the whole man. His whole being of grace consists in this, and his operations that necessarily follow this his being demonstrate this.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Job. 11.12.</note>Vain and empty man may imagine, <hi>that he is born as free as a wild As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Colt; i. e.</hi> bound to no Master, subject to no Yoke, but like a Wilde Colt the Foale of an Asse in the desert, that was never brought to hand. But let such a man or beast rather consult with the Book of God, and he shall finde this Universal Affirmative,<note place="margin">Prov. 16.4.</note>
                  <hi>that our Lord hath made all things for himself;</hi> and if all, then man likewise. Necessity then is laid upon man to serve his Maker; it is <hi>necessarium,</hi> it is <hi>Ʋnum Necessarium,</hi> necessary it is, that one necessary Point; from which will follow this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
               <p>That since this is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a necessary work; what tends not to this, is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> a matter by the by in comparison of this. Our maine business that we came for into the world, is to serve our Maker, and to save a soul; what conduceth to this end, would be our mark to shoot at, our scope to aim at: To all other things, as Riches, Poverty, Health, Sickness, Honour, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, such an indifferent affection would be borne, that we esteem not our selves happy with them, nor yet unhappy without them; that with a thankful heart we receive them if bestowed by God; and if it be his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to detaine or take them from us, we murmure, we repine not, because not any of these come within the Compasse of this <hi>One Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if this shall seem to any man rather a speculative, than a sad Truth, let him go to the Couch of a sick Worldling, or prophane person, and ask him then, what he judgeth to be of the greatest necessity? God, or his gold? God or his belly? Could a man behold and feel the secret throbs, the sad accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, the fearful remembrances of such a heart at that instant? no doubt, he should finde him of another judgement and Opinion, than he was in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:200414:12"/> ruff and heat of his jollity. Doubtless he would avow, that the remembrance of one houre laid out upon this necessary Point, did bring him at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant more solid comfort, than all the toyle and pleasure he took in these transitory things.</p>
               <p>Now, deare Brethren, give me leave I beseech you to bespeak you: I that am your Servant for God, you who profess your selves Servants to God:</p>
               <p>Use I entreat you, this experiment to your commodity, use it to your instruction, use it for a warning. That which thy Neighbour is now, thou must be ere long, a dying, a dead man. And of all follies, it is the greatest, not to fly dangers by the examples of others: The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a wise man and a fool being this, that the one foresees a mischief, and prevents it while there is time; the other would do it when it is too late. If thou couldst but now feel the state and case wherein thy poor heart shall be at the last gasp, for neglecting the study of this Necessary, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing that which then will not profit, thou woaldst take from thy meat, thy sleep, thy other occasions, to study this one Necessary indeed.</p>
               <p>It is the opinion of a great Divine of sound judgement, that the souls of Gods Saints in the houre of their departure,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bilson, Survey</hi> of Christs suff. p. 389.</note> are suffered to feel the touch and sting of bodily death, which is fully known to none but God who ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, or to her self that feels it; though this Agony of death be shortned or succour'd, as it pleaseth God in his mercy to dispose to every man. There is then more reason in that prayer which our Mother the Church hath taught us, than at first sight appeares, <hi>That God would deliver us in the houre of death, and in the day of judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of which terrour he that would take a full view, let him go into the Garden, and behold our Saviour in his <hi>Agony,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22.44.</note> when his soul was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged with sorrow; when he did sweat those clots and strings of blood ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping down unto the ground. He then saw God upon the Throne armed with wrath and indignation against the sinnes of ill the world. Then he saw, but felt not what the damned must feel, the fire of hell kindled to torment them who are hardned in their sinnes, and dye without Repentance in their wickedness. This wrung from him those drops, that blood, that fear, that prayer.</p>
               <p>Now if this day may prove a day of heaviness, one houre, one minute at least of that houre of darkness, even to those who all their lives have thought of this One thing, and studied this Needful Point: what is like to be to them, who because of <hi>Multa,</hi> many distractions, had no leisure to think of it; and for impertinent matters, have set by this Necessary, that have chang'd the first into the last, and put the last first! I cannot without horrour conceive of the horrour of that soul; I cannot without discomfort call to minde the discomforts of that houre. Doleful it is, to consider in what bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness, in what amazement, in what (I want words to express my thoughts) in what, in what astonishment that last divorce of this long wedded couple, the masculine soul, and the weaker body w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll be then made.</p>
               <p>True it is, that the godly ought not to be disheartned by that King of fear, since it is their good God who wounds and heales; their Jesus that kills and quickens; their Redeemer that brings to the Gates of Hell, and brings back againe. But yet they should consider the bitterness of death, which is the sting of sinne, and how justly they have deserved to be pierced and wounded with it; and so with a Religious feare, and most earnest prayer, beg of God assistance and defence against the terrour of Death, before they approach their end. No man ever breath'd out his soul without bitterness; but he with the most, who hath not all his life long had a careful eye, and a solicitous heart about this <hi>On Necessary.</hi>

            <p>The Subject I told you of this Text, is Religion, which is here commended to us under <hi>Maries</hi> choice, for four eminent qualities.</p>

               <item>2. For the necessity of it. It is a needful point; no man can be a Servant of God, or save a soul without it.</item>
               <item>3. For the perfection. It is without controversie, and beyond all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, <hi>A good part, the good part.</hi>

            <p>Two of these excellencies I have spoke of before; now I am to prosecute the other two, and to declare, That this part is a good part, and everlasting, which will justifie the more <hi>Maries</hi> discretion that she chose it; for what she did, was not done at all adventure; but upon mature deliberation she chose.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:200414:14"/>
               <p>And to say truth, a Religious life is alwayes best when chosen.

               <p>Of the end of Religion there is no doubt, there needs no consultation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that; for every man would be happy, and live for ever; Naturally our will is carried to that.

Nothing can be so convenient to man, as that which teacheth him to know God, to joyn him to God, to give God all honour and glory, and to live honestly, justly, peaceably among men; all which being the Dictates of Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd it must be to be the Good part.</p>
               <p>First, By Religion it is that we come to know God; thus the wise have defin'd it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Piety is the knowledge of God. <hi>The whole world,</hi> as saith Saint <hi>John, lies in darkness;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 5.19.</note> and if any light came to them by the Book of Nature, by it they might know that he is, not what he is; that to be worshipped, not how to be worshipped. To the question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, What God was, the wisest of them was fain to take a longer day, and to profess that he disputed the most wisely of God,<note place="margin">Simonides.</note> that said no more than <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That he is.</hi> What beyond this they knew,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> they were beholding to Revelation. For that Rule of <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> is undeniable, with which he often in that Book presseth the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>i. e.</hi> 'Tis not possible for them who had not before lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so great and Divine things from those that knew them, either themselves to know them, or rightly to teach others; whatsoever it was then that the Chaldees, Egyptians, or Greeks, knew or taught aright of God, that they received from <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, and stole it out of their Writings, though that the Theft should not appeare, they disguised it under other noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fictions;<note place="margin">Ambrose.</note> to the truth of Religion then they were beholding for what they knew or taught truly of God. <hi>Veritas à quocun{que} dicituri, à spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tu sancto profecta est,</hi> Truth by whomsoever it is said, yet it proceeds from the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But this is not all that Religion doth for us; for after it hath
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:200414:15"/> acquainted us with God, it joynes us close, and re-unites us to God. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionis nomen à vinculo pietatis deducitur,</hi> It hath its name <hi>à Religo,</hi> to binde. It bindes us in a Bond of piety; and to acknowledge that we are not at liberty, but bound and oblig'd to performe what we have undertaken. The very forme of the Indenture,<note place="margin">Hos. 2.23.</note> is thus drawn, <hi>I will say to them, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God;</hi> 'tis a mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract on his, on our part; it had its rise indeed from love; He lov'd first, and therefore we are but to love againe. In him it was free, in us it is duty; and that which sets the measure of this love (if it have any) and prescribes the Offices of this love, is Religion; we never can of these make due payment, till we are Religiously united to him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And from this loving union there flows another admirable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is an inward observance, and an outward adoration of that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, which a man esteems to be of so high and Divine a Nature. His study is to exalt God to the highest degree, and to abase himself to the lowest; so did the Father of the faithful in his Petition for <hi>Sodome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen: 18.27.</note> He acknowledgeth God to be his Lord, <hi>himself dust and ashes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such is the force of this Divine vertue, it makes a devout soul dedicate himself wholly to God; his body to be Gods Temple, his soul the Altar, his affections the offerings, his spirit his Image, the best expence of his time to serve, to extoll, to imitate, to implore his God. Religion prayes, Religion fasts, Religion adores, Religion it is that gives thanks, Religion that gives reverence to his holy Name, to holy dayes, to holy places; by this only it is that we yield obedience to what we should, confess, are sad, and ask pardon for what we cannot do.</p>
               <p>Go now and say, but with what face I know not, that Religion is not a good part, which teacheth so much good. If to know God, if to be united to God, if to exalt and glorifie God, if to adore, obey, worship, serve him, have any goodness in it, then certainly that must be good which teacheth the Rule and Practice of all these.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>2.</hi> Religion good for the Societies of men.</head>
               <p>But I come now to men; and if we shall prize and esteem that duty which man owes to man, and the performance of it as wonderfully condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the conservation of Humane Societies, Religion must be confess'd to be a Good part. It is no peculiar conceit, but a matter of sound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that all just and charitable duties, are by so much the kindlier performed, by how much the men are more Religious from whom they proceed.</p>
               <p>No act of Justice is so genuinely executed, as where the feare of God is the first moving cause, his glory the end; and the Rule by which Justitiaries proceed, his Word and Will, and not some sinister respect, or crooked line of their own. For if those who fill the seats of Justice, follow it only as a Trade, with unquenchable and unconscionable thirst of gain, being not fully perswaded in heart, that justice is Gods own work, and themselves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Agents about it; that which was ordain'd for the common good, will be made the very Rod and Scourge to torment poor innocents, and a cause of a common misery.</p>
               <p>Those who extoll the Golden age, acquaint us with many admirable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,<note place="margin">Ovid. Met. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siod.</note> as that men at that time, of their own accord; without any Law, kept their Word, their faith with men, that they lov'd what was right, and hated what was wrong; that not feare of revenge or punishment, but meer love of vertue and equity was a barre against all oppressions. And how came this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:200414:15"/> about? The gods, say their Poets, did as yet dwell and converse with men; they had those, though feigned Deityes for their Tutors, for their Directors, for their Guardians; and they were so Religiously aw'd by their presence, that they had no thought to attempt any unjust act; but upon their retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Heaven, then
<q>
                     <l>—Fugere pudor, verumque, fidesque.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>And justice and all fled together.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Ʋltima caelestûm terras Astraea reliquit.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The truth I confesse is disguised in a fiction; but the Moral is, That where God is, there will be good; and where good is, 'tis the work of a Religious feare.</p>
               <p>To go one step further, let the god be never so strange and false, yet in the Religion of that god, some principles are true, from which have sprung notable effects for the benefit of mankinde. Not a man among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who had or hath a stock, a stone, a clout, a Fetisso for his god, but will yield you this Principle, that breach of Oaths is detestable to their Deity; and that such as should be wilfully guilty of that hateful crime, alwayes were to be pursued with Divine Vengeance. It was their errour to attribute so great power to their Puppets and false gods; yet the right conceit they had, That to perjury, and injustice, vengeance belongs; made, and doth yet make them so punctual in their Contracts which they make with men.</p>
               <p>I verily believe, that those specious vertues, their milde severity, their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere but exact justice, their chastity, sobriety, valour, their integrity and honest simplicity which we read of, admire, and commend in the Heathen, were no other than the fruits of true Religion; some Axioms and Principles whereof, were by God rooted and imprinted in their hearts; for they were but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Thieves of other mens goods; having borrowed,<note place="margin">Clem. Alex.</note> or if you will, pilfer'd from Gods Truth, whatsoever they published and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised as true.</p>
               <p>These Maxims common to them with us, tyed the hands from violence, the tongue from blasphemy, the eyes from beholding vanity, the heart from impure conceptions, the head from Treasonable plots, and the feet from running to vile excess; upon all these Religion laid a strait, but an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Yoke; which, who so cast off, were even by themselves branded and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd among the irreligious.</p>
               <p>But if it be said, that these effects being common to all Religions; to the false, as well as the true; therefore the goodness even of those is this way set forth, as well as of the Religion we profess: I would have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,</p>
               <p>First, That these effects proceeded, as I said before, from those common Truths and Maxims, in which the falsest Religion in the world doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the true; <hi>viz. That there is a God;</hi> that this God is to be honoured; that this God hates cruelty and injustice; that this God hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a revengeful eye; that he is a holy God, and doth detest unholy actions and persons. To the truth of Religion the effects may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, though they that do them are not of a true Religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That howsoever this their Religion, be it what it will be, may teach them some Truths, and dictate some good things; yet it is not in all things absolute, in all things good, as is the Christian Religion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not that good parr which our Saviour here commends in <hi>Maries</hi> choice. It will not then be amiss next to examine, how farre that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion we professe is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that good part,</hi> and excells all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions that ever were yet in the world.</p>

Let then this be the <hi>Lydian</hi> stone to make the trial; that which will distinguish Christian Religion from the rest, and give it a preheminence above the rest; we need no other.

                  <hi>Moses</hi> admitted a <hi>Bill of divorce.</hi> And in the Commands of the second Table, they gave an indulgence to themselves to hate, they took liberty to be angry, to slaunder, though they might <hi>not kill.</hi> A wanton eye was thought no crime; or an adulterous heart esteemed no fault.<note place="margin">28. 33.</note> With others they jested, and so that they kept from perjury, to sweare by the Temple, was nothing with them. 'Tis not their practice I speak of,<note place="margin">21.</note> 'tis of their Doctrines; these were the Commandments of men currant among them, and these they had been taught from the Ancients.

               <p>There is but one more which stands out in competition with the Christian Religion, and this is that of the Impostor <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and he that should read his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> would conceive he hoped rather to meet with beasts than men. To say nothing of his disguised Stories of the Patriarchs, stoln by him out of <hi>Moses,</hi> but chang'd into lyes, and old Wives Tale; who can Relate the stories of Angel <hi>Adriels</hi> death, <hi>Seraphuels</hi> Trumpet, <hi>Gabriels</hi> Bridge, <hi>Herroth</hi> and <hi>Marroths</hi> hanging, the Moons descent into his sleeve, the Angels Hammer, the Litter, and much of the same Bran without laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! Besides these ridiculous Fables, how doth he sooth up nature; A man would think he heard <hi>Epicurus</hi> rather reading a flattering Lecture of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, than a grave Law-giver; for his Ordinances are encouragements to licence baits of pleasure; his heaven somewhat like the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> a Paradise of Amorous Ladies; by him revenge is encourag'd, multitude of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:200414:16"/> Wives tolerated, theft allowed. Reason it self being the impress of God in man, hath light enough to perswade that this Religion cannot be good, whose Laws are wicked and licentious, and credit bolster'd up by lyes, fables, and impostures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On the contrary, by Christian Religion</hi> we curb Nature; we restraine, we discourage, we threaten her; teaching not to rest in outward actions of piety, or dispensations of men, but to strive unto sincerity, without which we may expect no part in Christ, no salvation, no future life, no help in our prayers, in Sacraments, in any Christian duties. Call upon men we do to set the heart to work in all Devotions, without which the lips are but ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers; to set the hand to work in all good actions, without which the heart is but an hypocrite. Our Law is an undefiled Law, <hi>and converts the soule.</hi>

                  </note> With us it is a sufficient matter of accusation, not only to be wicked, but to carry a heart, and a desire to be such. For we prohibit the very purpose as well as the Act and the Deed. Chastity is so farre exacted by this good Law, that it puts a Covenant upon the wanton eye,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.28.</note> and a restraint upon the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous heart.

               <p>Now let me appeale to your own soul, and unto the judgement of the whole world, whether that Religion must not be good, whose rules are so good, whose commands so holy? Whether it be possible, that should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its rise and being from flesh and blood, which keeps under, opposes, destroyes flesh and blood? That certainly, which is so opposite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to mens affections, so cross to their mindes, must be from heaven; that which commands men <hi>to be holy as God is holy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.16. Jam. 1.17.</note> must needs be from a holy God, and consequently it must be good; <hi>for every good gift comes from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variableness, nor shadow of turning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Could I finde the least favour given to our will and natural corruption in it, I should suspect that the Authour of it consulted with flesh and blood; as those we see do, that break,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.16.</note> or countenance their breaches by some or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Clause they finde written in it; forc'd they are <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>to wrest the place,</hi> and set it on the Rack as it were, and torture it, before it can be got to confess and countenance what they would have it. But when I cannot finde here the least indulgence or dispensation granted to the least sin, no,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 5.22.</note> not to the appearance of evil, convicted I am, and so must any man that carries not about him an obstinate soul, that this is alone the good part; or since some will so have it, the best part; nor Heathenish civilities, nor Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Ceremonies, nor Turkish Libertinisme may be named in the same day with it.</p>
               <p>Honesty then and piety we have to plead for us; justice and charity, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of sufficient weight to get the good-will of a vertuous soul. But that which most works upon the hearts of most men, is <hi>Ʋtile,</hi> profit.</p>

               <p>It is an errour then with which many men are seduced, that no man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into eternal life before he dyes; for whilst he lives among men in the Church Militant, he must set his foot upon the Borders of it. He must live the life of grace, that intends to live the life of glory; which two differ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this, that this is a gracious, but that a gracious and glorious life.

               <p>To shut up all then, remember this Truth, that you must carry somewhat out of this World with you when you go hence; somewhat that will not leave you. It is the life of grace which you must begin here, if you hope to be perfect there; study to be gracious, or you can have little confidence to be glorious.<note place="margin">1 John 3.2, 3.</note> So saith St. <hi>John, Whosoever hath this hope,</hi> that is, <hi>to be like God, and see him as he is,</hi>

            <p>Here then is good Christian counsel given, and that it may be the better taken, the Apostle ushers it in with a word of love, <hi>Brethren.</hi>

               <p>Had Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by this appellation intended to bring to their memory, only his alliance and neerness of blood with the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as one descended of the same stock with them, it had been a powerful motive to gain attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for such was his heaviness, and continual sorrow for these his <hi>Brethren,</hi> his kinsmen in the flesh,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.2, 3.</note>

               <p>But evident it is that many of these <hi>Hebrews</hi> to whom he writes, were of a more noble Brother-hood;<note place="margin">cap. 12.13. 1 Pet. 2.17.</note> that Brother-hood which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> gives in charge to love.

For this being granted, as indeed it must, that all Christians (ever since Christ himself was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to call them Brethren) are of the same house and Brother-hood:<note place="margin">Heb. 2.11.</note>

               <p>All we that speak in the spirit of meekness, dare not be suspected for such ill counsellours.

No question, it were a wise and a pious meditation thus for a man to discourse with his own soul in the morning; This day I am to enter into the World, and snares are set for me in every place; be it that I be not very cautelous, no help for me but I must be taken. Suppose I am going to prayer, my heart will be ready to suggest some idle thought; whence our Saviour puts in his Caveat for that, <hi>Take heed how ye pray.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>3.</hi> Take heed that there be not in any of you a heart of unbelief.</head>
               <p>We need not go farre to search into the nature of this sin; for the Apostle hath in this place lively set it forth before our eyes, by the seat, the cause, the effect; the seat where it rests, is the heart; the cause, the naughty malignant quality of the heart; the effect, Apostacy, revolt, separation; it withdraws from the living God.</p>
               <p>For whereas Divine Revelations, Gods comfortable promises, his fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgements, obedience to his Commandments, are the object of our faith; unbelief seated in the heart, labours to perswade that these are neither good, nor true, nor necessary. Not good, for they oppose our appetite; not true, for they contradict our reason; not necessary, for we can well live, nay live more contentedly without them; and being not true, we need not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them; and being not good, nor necessary, we need not obey them.</p>
               <p>This is that which God so much complains of by his Prophet,<note place="margin">Hosea 8.12.</note>
                  <hi>I have written unto them the wonderful things of my Law, and they accounted them a strange thing;</hi> strange to their judgements, for they did not prize them, nor esteem them, but lay them by, as some refuse stuff; strange to their thoughts, for they did not minde them, not meditate on them; strange to their affections, they loved them not, they liked them not, could finde no taste, no relish at all in them; strange to their practice, for they cast them behind their back,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:200414:21"/> and scorn'd to live after them; and all this practical Atheism arose from an incredulous heart. Our Saviour makes it evident, when he breaks thus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically upon his Disciples, or the multitude rather, <hi>O faithless, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse generation!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 17.17.</note> faithless first, and perverse after; intimating that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward perverseness of their wills proceeded from their weakness of faith; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse they had never been, had they not been faithless.</p>
               <p>For infidelity is the great grandame of all mischief; it multiplies sinnes, and encreaseth these accursed Brats from generation to generation; to me it seems very like the <hi>Indian</hi> figtree,<note place="margin">Clusius.</note> or <hi>arbor de raes,</hi> which growing out of the ground with many boughs, yields certain gummy strings of the colour of gold; these roping down to the earth, do there take root, and make as it were new trees, or a wood of Trees; from the first stock there spring so many plants by a perpetual succession, that they cover by this means the best part sometimes of a mile. This is a lively embleme of infidelity; for where it roots, it shoots, and every sin is a branch of it; and these so chain'd and linked together, that they cover a whole Country. There is not a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness to be named, that one way or other hath not its rise and dependence from this root; the overflowing of sin is from hence; so that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the specious Titles of Christians, Believers, Professours, a man may yet propose the Prophets Question,<note place="margin">Isa. 53.1.</note>
                  <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> Our Saviour allows us to judge of the Tree by the fruits; and the fruits I am sure, Proclaime that there is in most Christians, an unbelieving heart.</p>
               <p>First, The presence of Gods eye is not believed to be at our thoughts, over our actions. For we are ashamed to do many things in the eyes of men, that we colour not to plot and act in the eye of God; did we believe that God were by, we would stand in awe; at least not be audacious to sin. The Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist tells us of men that encourage themselves in mischief, and lay snares; and upon what ground but this,<note place="margin">Psal. 64.5. Psalm 73.11.</note>
                  <hi>That God was not in their thoughts? Tush, say they, how should God know? is there knowledge in the Most High?</hi> This is the first-born of infidelity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Neither do most men believe the particular providence of God; a general Father perhaps confess him they may; but no kinde Father to provide for them; and therefore they will provide for themselves. In their wants <hi>they trust to their wits;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hab. 1.16. Jer. 17.5. 1 Sam. 28.7. 2 Kings 1. Psalm 18.30.</note> in their distresses, <hi>to some arme of flesh;</hi> in their sickness, <hi>some run to the Witch at Endor,</hi> or <hi>the god of Ekron.</hi> God is forsaken upon the least occasion, or least trusted, though he hath promised <hi>never to forsake those that trust to him;</hi> and this is another childe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Again, many call him <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> but believe not so; for why should men conceive and call him Lord,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.21. Luke 6.46. Jer. 35.8, 15, 16, 17.</note> and do so little that he bids them? The words of <hi>Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his sons, are performed; but I, saith the Lord, have spoken, Do this,</hi> and yet there is no more heed given to my Commands, than to dreames; as little account made of what I say, as if my injunctions were not given in earnest, I meant not what I said, nor intended to call for an account of what I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. This is Infidelities impudent and graceless son. For could this bold disobedience be found in any professour of Religion, did he believe that his Lord is a great and a jealous God? of Authority to command, of power to punish?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Farther yet believed it is by some, that there be other expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of sin than by effusion of blood;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers.</note> and upon it there be that erre in the prime Article. For an example of holy life, they will admit the life of the Son of God; and his death for a pattern of patience, but not for a satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:200414:21"/> not for a ransome. The goodness or God, they tell us, may make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to his justice, the blood of his Son was not requisite: Whereas the Scripture in plaine terms informs us, That when Christ suffered,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Mark 10.46. 1 Tim. 2.6.</note> there was a Demonstration of his justice, and a full Declaration of his anger, <hi>that he made his soul an offering for sin;</hi> with which <hi>God was so well-pleased, that he did accept this his precious blood,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, But this, as it is not believed by some, so it is not regarded by others; for many tread under foot the Sonne of God, crucifying by their prophane life him afresh; who beare their heads so high,<note place="margin">John 19.30.</note> as if Christ had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bowed his head, <hi>and given up his soul upon the cross for them.</hi> And these are two twins of infidelity, of a later birth; for the innocent and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Christians of the Primitive Church knew them not; whereof the first believes not his Doctrine, and the last seem to dis-believe his Death.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, As for heaven and the glory thereof,<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.31, 32.</note> they are entertain'd as the musique of a pleasant song; much commended they are for the aire, and for that vouchsafed the hearing, and yet in a trice as little remembred of the one, as of the other.

               <p>Seventhly, Lastly, The terrours of the Lord, are no terrours to many;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.11.</note> nor the Angels Trumpet, nor the last judgement, nor the ensuing torments; for were men fully convinc'd of the wrath and vengeance of that day,<note place="margin">John 2.2.

Dan. 4.27. 1 Cor. 11.31.</note> the <hi>darkness, the gloominess,</hi> the fearful and final sentence, and that the paines of hell were such as indeed they are, they would <hi>tremble with Foelix when they heard a discourse of the last judgement;</hi> they would <hi>break off their sins by repentance, and judge thems<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To collect all, since the presence of God, nor yet his providence, since the Commands of the Almighty, nor yet his only Sons Sacrifice, since the joyes of heaven, nor the sorrows of hell can have a sufficient influence to better mens lives; Evident it is, <hi>that all are not Israel, that are of Israel;</hi>

                     <hi>1.</hi> First then of those that know not; and beware of that kinde of incredulous Heart.</head>
                  <p>A Latitude there is in the apprehension of the object of faith; and to set a bound to this, and strictly to define just how far you must know in every particular, or incur damnation, is no work for my shallow capacity.</p>
                  <p>I can easily admit the school distinction of <hi>explicita &amp; implicita fides,</hi> in a good sense, and yet neither plead for the Colliers faith, nor maintain that ignorance is the Mother of Devotion. By <hi>fides explicita,</hi> we mean a cleare, distinct, and particular faith or belief of any Point or Article of Christian Religion. By <hi>fides implicita,</hi> a more dark, secret, or hidden belief implied, and as it were wrapped up in the belief of another more general Article. As for example; in the Article of Christs Incarnation, we do believe clearly and distinctly, not only that Christ the Son of God was made flesh for us, but further, that in particular there were in him two Natures, but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; two distinct wills; the humane Nature passible, the Divine impassible. But yet some other men are not bound to know these and other particulars so distinctly as Schollars; it sufficeth that they know them by an implyed faith. The Article they must know and believe distinctly, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Son of God was incarnate for mans Redemption; but the consequences of it no farther than their capacities or education, time, station can reach to. God forbid that we should tye up every unlearned man to that measure of knowledge which is requisite in the Priest and greatest Clarks; who, be they never so learned, must believe also many mysteries in the Scripture, which they are not able to explain with an implicite faith, or else God help them.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Luke 12.48.</note>1. This I know, <hi>that to whomsoever God hath given more, more of him shall be required;</hi> as well in belief as obedience; and therefore many things may be necessary for a knowing mans salvation, which are not so necessary for a poor simple soul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This again is most certain, that the peremptory establishing of many points (which are remote deductions from the first agreed on principle) to be believ'd as matters of faith necessary to salvation, hath lost the peace and unity of the Church, as is evident by the <hi>Trent</hi> Articles.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And the Learned and Judicious have been very sober and charitable in their judgements to weaker capacities, whatsoever zealous Gnosticks press to the contrary. A false conceit is crept into the minds of men, to imagine
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:200414:22"/> that the points of Religion that be manifest, are but some petty points; scarce worth the learning; Those to be great, and none to those that have subtile di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes about them.</p>

                  <p>But these men must know, that the height and sublimity of many myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Divinity is such, that they are to be believed and assented to meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Gods Revelation, since they do surpass the poor capacity and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of man; such as are the Creation of the World of nothing, the mystery of the Trinity, the Incarnation of the Son of God, his birth of a Virgin, and the Resurrection of our bodies. These, humane reason cannot reach to, though they be not contrary to it, but above it; To these then we must as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and not discourse; believe, though we have no other evidence than Gods bare word for them.<note place="margin">Augustin. tract. <hi>79.</hi> in Joan.

                  <p>Out of this I infer, that every one ought to come, and intreat of these high mysteries that immediately belong to faith and belief, with great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, respect, modesty, and submission; not condemning that which his sense and reason cannot fathome, nor making the depth of his own capacity, the rule and measure of his belief. Be it that our reason and sense resist and rise against it;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5.</note> yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> requires that we captivate our understanding, <hi>or bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what then? is there no place for reason in matters of faith? may there not from thence be fetch't motives to gaine our assent? Yes certainly, for besides those above-named mysteries, there are other Articles of our faith, which are both believ'd, and taken up upon sound reason, because they may be demonstrated, as that there is a God, that he is but One, that he by his providence governs the World; that he hath ordain'd rewards for the good, and punishments to the bad; so that he shall be not only no Christian, but no man that assents not to these: And for these we have a double light; one of reason, the other of Revelation; yet so as to perswade the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we farre prefer the <hi>Medium</hi> of Revelation, before that drawn from reason; concluding rather as a Divine, than a Philosopher.</p>
                  <p>And yet for all this, we may use many other Arguments to gaine assent. For it being supposed, which in reason must be granted, that God created man for happiness; and happy be could never be without the true knowledge of him; and this knowledge could not be had without Revelation; and this Revelation is extant in no Book but the Scripture; it will necessarily follow, that the Scripture is the Word of God deliver'd to the Prophets; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, whatsoever is in the Old Testament, is to be believ'd; which being granted, it is not hard to prove and demonstrate the Truth of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion against either Jew or Gentile.</p>

What should I say, that the hatred that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and all his Instruments have borne to this Religion, their endeavour to the utter extinguishment of it! Gods goodness yet in its preservation, the miracles by which he confirmed it, the foretelling so punctually, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling all things about it, are Arguments more than humane to gain our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and to keep us from this heart of unbelief; whether passive or active (for so the Hebrew Genetive Case of the Substantive sometimes signifies) from the passive, that it take no root in us, much less that it be active, pragmatical, and working, raise in us a spirit of contradiction against so appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Truth.</p>
                  <p>And to give countenance to these Arguments of credibility,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. <hi>à</hi> 17. ad. 21.</note> we have the example of Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> who the better to prevaile with those to whom he Writ, first assures them that he was not induced by vain fables, but that he had strong motives for the same; as First, That he and the rest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had conversed with Christ, and were all eye-witnesses of his doings. Secondly, That a voice from Heaven, the <hi>Bath-Col,</hi> at his Masters Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> was by him heard, which did assure him that Christ was the Son of God, and to be heard.

                  <p>Seen you have in faith, that knowledge is necessary, and therefore you must take heed of affected ignorance. Then that assent is necessary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must take heed also of obstinate and wilfull opposition.

                  <p n="1">1. For first, if your affections be not cleansed, all the Arguments of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility in the world will no more work a man from Infidelity, than the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of <hi>John</hi> wrought with <hi>Herod;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 9. Acts 24.</note> nor Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> conference with <hi>Foelix.</hi> And the cause is, that however the understanding enlightens, and reason it were that the will should follow that light, yet the predominancy of the affections is so powerful, that they carry the matter; As a man is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or dis-affected, so goes our judgement and understanding also.</p>

                  <p>I see the best, saith the understanding; I approve it, saith the will, but I follow the worst upon the verdict of the affections. When the affections are not rightly moved, there will be no true choice made, nor of faith, nor any other good.</p>
                  <p>This is that which our Saviour asks the Jews, <hi>How can ye believe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 5.44.</note>
                     <hi>see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ye seek glory one of another?</hi> Their affections were ambitious, and that was an impediment to their faith so long as they were transported with vain-glory; nor his Sermons, nor his Miracles, nor <hi>Johns mourning,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 7.32.</note> nor his <hi>piping,</hi> could free their hearts from unbelief. So that where this pious affection is not, no love of, nor no delight in the Truth, or at least where it is not in some degree purged from the love of our selves, the love of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, riches, and other sensualities, that it remaineth with some indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of desire to know and follow the Truth, there can be no good hoped for. It behoves then every man that intends to cast away this heart of unbelief, to dispossess himself of his passions, which raise in him sinister prejudices against the Truth; (of which these Hebrews were very guilty) and that he place himself in such an indifferency and evenness of minde, that he may be able to look upon, and discerne the Truth with an unpassionate eye when presented to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Lastly, After we do affect the Truth, necessary it is also that we apply it to our own souls; for Application is the very life of faith; the sole water that can revive a <hi>fainting spirit, Jonathans honey, Hagars well.</hi>

                  <p>And this is usually call'd particular faith, which respects not so much the object, as is an infused habit into man. It is not the faith which we believe, as that faith by which we believe. A quality then it is, and therefore as all other qualities it must admit of degrees. So that in respect of the Subject or person in whom it is, it is more or less; for there is a strong faith, and a weak faith. A strong faith there is, such as was in <hi>Abraham, who stagger'd not in the promise through unbelief.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4.20.</note> Such was in the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to whom our Saviour gives this Testimony, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith!</hi> And there is a weak faith;<note place="margin">Mat. 15.28.

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet this little faith is of the same nature with the great. For <hi>magis &amp; minus nos variant speciem,</hi> more or less do never alter the nature of any thing; The same then I say it is; and though it have not the same comfort, yet it hath the same promise. Give eare to those comfortable words of our Saviour, <hi>Blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</hi>

                  <p>Now according to the degree of faith, such is the apprehension; and as a man apprehends, so he applies. Where the apprehension is stronger, there the Application is stronger; and where it is weaker, that is weaker also; To some, God gives the spirit of confirmation and obsignation, as in those I now named; as in particular to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who could say with comfort, <hi>I have sought a good fight, I have kept the faith; henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of righteousnesse, &amp;c.</hi> and happy are they, thrice happy, that have this assurance; which if another man cannot say with the same confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it will not presently be want of faith in him, as long as this want proceeds not from any distrust of the Truth of Gods promise, but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus it fares with such a man, as with him who is fallen into a deep ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.7, 8. Archb. of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh. ex Bern.</hi>

This man so soon as he was fastned to the bough, was in a safe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though <hi>terrent jam nubila mentem,</hi> all feares and terrours are not out of his minde, untill he comes to himself, and sees himself out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; Then he is sure he is safe, but he was safe before he was sure. Just so it is with a believer; Faith is but the espying of Christ as that bough, the only meanes to save a life, and the reaching out the heart as the man his hand, to lay hold on him; it informes the soul, God hath ordain'd his Sonne to be his Saviour. So soon as the soul with joy apprehends this, God imputes the righteousness of his Son unto it, and it is actually justified in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:200414:25"/> the Court of Heaven, though it is not presently quieted in the Court of conscience; that may be afterwards done by degrees, in some sooner, in some later as God pleaseth. For I doubt not but the Spirit of God being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored by devout and humble prayer, and sincere obedience, may and will by degrees advance his Servants higher, and give them the certainty of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence beyond their certainty of evidence; but what he gives as a reward to believers, is one thing; and what he requires as a duty, is another; and what he will accept out of grace and favour, is a Third.</p>

                  <p>First, A confident perswasion, that if I faile not on my part, Christ will not faile on his; if I do repent and believe, no power in heaven, earth, or hell, shall deprive me of any part of his promise.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That I set my self seriously to perform the condition upon which this promise is made.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To examine my heart how farre I have perform'd the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and upon evidence of conscience given of the performance, conclude, that I am one of those to whom the promise belongs, if I persevere and continue. But there being very much uncertainty whether I judge rightly of my self, the conclusion drawn from thence, can be no stronger than the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my conscience; and then I shall apply Christ with no more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and comfort to me, than the degrees of faith and repentance are in me; weakly if weak, and strongly if strong; yet comfortably in both; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as I said, <hi>Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This have I spoken, or collected rather out of three Learned Divines, that they who are of a feeble heart, and of a weak faith, may receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; Too too often they are dejected, when they read those severe words written by men of great credit, that every man is bound to be certain of his Salvation without doubt, and to believe it as certainly as an Article of his Creed.</p>
                  <p>Take this position rigidly, and it cannot be true; for those we believe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods Revelation, whereas the other can have no other evidence than the Ce tificate of our own soul; that Testimony is Divine, this but Humane, and therefore not of equal strength with the other. If it be said, that this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is supplied by the work of Gods Spirit in the conscience; I answer, that this work is not in all the faithful alike; and therefore all have not, nor are bound to have the same assurance. He must needs have more, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a greater measure of the Spirit; and he less, to whom the Spirit is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a lesser degree.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:200414:26"/> a holy despair, when these proceed from an humble soul conscious of its own wants, unworthiness, and imperfections, and not from this evil heart of unbelief which draws from the living God.</p>
                  <p>One Question I shall yet demand of this disconsolate soul, Whether when he doubts, he would not doubt? whether when he despairs, he would not despair? to which if he shall answer his heart is against both, then I dare assure him, that he neither wants faith nor hope, for he desires both; and these desires are accepted of God, and make him a happy man.</p>
                  <p>Here again I shall ingeminate to him, that never too often repeated, and that never to be forgotten promise of our Saviour, <hi>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 5.6.</note> Which verse containing the most comfortable promise that ever was made to a poor dejected, but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and believing Sinner, I shall first Explaine, then apply to my purpose.</p>
                  <p>By righteousness we are to understand, 1. That which is inherent. 2. Then that which is imputed. The inherent is imperfect, proportionable to our estate, consisting in true sanctification and holiness, enabling a man <hi>to mortifie his sinnes and lusts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.13. Mat. 3.8. 1 Cor. 13.13. Tit. 1.16.33. 1 Pet. 2.8.</note> and <hi>to bring forth the fruits of repentance,</hi> and to beautifie his soul with the vertues of <hi>Faith, Hope, and Charity;</hi> so that there be none truly <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, none unbelievers but <hi>the disobedient.</hi> And happy is the soul that hungers and Thirsts after this righteousness.</p>
                  <p>But because this righteousness in what degree soever is unperfect, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary it is,<note place="margin">Luke 17.10. Phil. 3.12. Rom. 3.23. Rom. 9.30, 31, 32,</note> that we hunger and Thirst after another, which is the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ arising out of his obedience, whereby he fulfilled the Law, and satisfied the punishment in his life, and in his death for us; which obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience both merited the Remission of our sinnes, and effectually wrought the righteousness of the Law, and acceptation of our persons in Christ. For the deriving whereof to us, two things must be done; one on Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, the other on ours. That which God doth, is call'd <hi>Imputation;</hi> That which we do, is call'd <hi>Believing in Christ,</hi> and so receiving that which God offereth. And happy is that soule to whom this Righteousness is imputed.</p>
                  <p>And now behold in this promise the tender mercies of our good God. The comfort is, that the promise is made to those who hunger and Thirst for this righteousness,<note place="margin">Luke 1.78. Isa. 54.7.55.3.</note> and not to those that have it. That the Possessours of it are a blessed people, is without question; but that those should be blessed also who unfainedly desire it, is a wonderful condescension and indulgence, and the greatest stay to a fainting soul, that possibly can be. For how many are there whose faith is so weak, that they cannot perswade themselves of Gods good-will toward them, that their sins for Christs sake shall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that God is reconciled to them, and will save them? How many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that finding themselves fall short of that righteousness, and holiness, mortification, Repentance and purity, which the Gospel exacts, are ready even to give up the ghost!</p>
                  <p>Now that which only can revive the spirit, and give assurance to such a gasping soul, is, That Christ hath promised blessedness to our desires; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires like to that of a hungry and Thirsty man, which will best teach us how these desires must be qualified.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They must be eager, earnest, impatient, unsatiable, serious; for such is our appetite to meat and drink when we are hungry and Thirsty. True de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires then are no faint desires, but affectionate, proceeding of a real sense of what we want, and without the obtaining of which it will not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:200414:26"/>2. They must be laborious and painful, content to undergo any paines to be satisfied. For Hunger and Thirst, we say, will break stone walls, make a man feed upon his own flesh rather than starve. True desires then are no lazy or idle desires, but will be up and doing;<note place="margin">Numb. 23.10.</note> not only wish <hi>to dye the death of the righteous,</hi> but labour to live the life of the righteous. The formal man finds it an easie matter to believe; Satan troubles him not, his heart smites him not. But the true believer is often in a conflict;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.5.</note>
                     <hi>without fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, within feares;</hi> without Satan assaults him, pleading his faith as naught, and within his flesh opposes and feares him, that Satan sayes true. Whence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <note place="margin">1 Thes. 1.2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They must be constant desires; last and continue, though they have their intervals, fits, and swoonings; as Thirst half quenched, and Hunger half slaked, they alwayes return. <hi>Nunquam expletur, nec satiatur hujus cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iditatis sitis,</hi> The Thirst of this righteousness is never fill'd, nor satisfi'd; though he have never so much of it to day, yet he longs for more of it to morrow; and therefore constantly and dayly cryes to heaven, Give, Give, ever more good Father <hi>give me of this water;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 4.15.6.33.</note> of this <hi>bread</hi> that came down from heaven. Earnestness, painfulness, and constancy, are the true Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of these desires; earnestness excludes formality, labour laziness, and constancy instability and levity.</p>
                  <p>These give Title to men of all the merciful promises of God. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Reconciliation to God in Christ so qualified, is Reconciliation it self.<note place="margin">

Not so in the Nature of the thing; for I know well, that the desire is one thing, and the thing desired another: But so it is in Gods acceptation, otherwise he had never said, <hi>Blessed are those that hunger and thirst;</hi> and past his word, <hi>I will give to him that thirsts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 22.17.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much I shall now demonstrate unto you, and that by the chief kinde of demonstration, the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from the cause to the effect. For from whence come these desires? whence this hunger and Thirst to be reconciled to God? from the flesh, or from the Spirit?<note place="margin">Rom. 8.7. James 4.4. Gal. 5.17.</note> From the flesh they can never come; for <hi>the desires of the flesh are enmity to God; The flesh lusteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Spirit;</hi> riseth, opposeth, and labours to continue the Quarrel betwixt God and man. It must then surely proceed from the Spirit of God that dwells in us, which lusteth against the flesh, and moves us to Thirst for that justice which we feel we want. These holy desires then being the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Holy Ghost within us, are sure Testimonies of our faith, though they be small and weak; For as a woman that feeles the motion of a childe within her womb, though it be scarce sensible, yet assures her self that she hath conceiv'd. So if we have these motions, these desires, these holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections so qualified as I but now mentioned, we need not doubt but we have receiv'd a portion of Gods Spirit; and consequently, that we belong to him; <hi>for hereby we know that he abides in us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 3.24.</note>
                     <hi>by the Spirit that he hath given us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To knit up this Point, the Summe is, That every true believer is bound to lay hold on Christ by the hand of a particular faith; that this hand in all is not of equal strength, that it may hold fast when it feels not; and that God hath promised blessedness to those who seriously, eagerly, laboriously, and constantly keep their hold-fast, wrastle with him all night,<note place="margin">Gen. 32.26.</note> and will not let him go without a <hi>Blessing.</hi> This is the comfort of a dejected, gasping, and Thirsty soul.</p>
                  <p>But two sorts of men are like to receive discomfort from it. 1. The care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. 2. The over-bold.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:200414:27"/>
                  <p>First, A careless sort of men there are, that think it enough to know there is a God, and that by his Son he Redeemed the World, in which they exceed not, nay come short of Satan. But to be assured how far God is their God, and to have a Seal for their particular pardon, they trouble not themselves. No pains is taken for this assurance, this Third Act of faith, without which they can have no comfort in Christ.</p>

                  <p>Take heed then, you <hi>that be at ease in Zion,</hi> be not wanting to your selves in this part of belief.<note place="margin">Amos 6.1.</note> For this application can alone cure you, and must be your comfortable Certificate in your way to heaven; without which you shall dye <hi>without hope,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, And on the other side, take heed of presumption too, for there is a great errour committed that way: An errour that leads more to hell, than the other; for too too many there are, that apply Christ in their own conceits, when the Truth is nor so, nor so. They salute Christ, when be re-salutes them not;<note place="margin">Heb. 11.13. Mat. 7.22.</note> and take acquaintance of him, when he will not know them <hi>Eo die.</hi> A day will come, when a multitude of people will tell him to his face, that they gloried in his Name, were his best Servants, and zealous Saints waited upon him, fought for him, prophesied, and went up and down, and Preached a multitude of Sermons in his Name, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the Gospel, and did wonders, and thereupon challenge a kindnesse from him;<note place="margin">Matth. 7.23.</note> whom yet he will discharge with a <hi>Nescio vos, Depart from me, for I know you not.</hi> Their application, by the scorne put upon it, appears to be but a fancy swimming in their braine; like the eating of bread, or drinking of Wine in a dream.<note place="margin">Isa. 29.8.</note> And that no man be hereafter deluded with it, give me leave to set down some certain Characters, by which it may be known, whether the application of Christ be true or presumptuous.</p>
                  <p>First, He that applyes Christ truly, falls in love with Christ; he seeks him not for the <hi>Loaves and Fishes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 6.26. 2 Kings 10.16. Cant. 4.11.</note> nor labours to erect Christs Kingdom, that he may set up his own, but he loves him for himself, and follows him for that vertue that is in him. His Saviours lips drop like an honey-comb, and his desire is to hang upon them. And he loves whatsoever is his; his Servants,<note place="margin">Jer. 15.16. Psal. 119.105.24.</note> his Wayes, his Works, but his Word above all things; This he makes his light to see by, his counsel to learne by, his Law to live by, his Glass to look into, and mend what is amiss. <hi>His Faith works by love.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, And out of this love there ariseth a desire of Reconciliation before any thing in the world. Too often he knows, he hath given Christ occasion to fall out with him; and therefore he is never at rest, till he hath recovered his good-will again. The frownes of his Beloved break his heart, and therefore he hungers and thirsts after peace.<note place="margin">Psal. 42.1, 2.</note> The chased Hart desires not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:200414:27"/> so much <hi>the water brooks,</hi> as his soul pants to be in favour with his God. Upon any falling out, He, or rather <hi>the Spirit that helps his infirmities,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes with sighs and groanes within him, and with him seriously and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, till God say unto his soul, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy sin.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.13.</note> This is not the desire of a half Christian, who much regards not the justice of the Almighty, nor much feares his anger. Salvation he would fain have, and will often beg, but Reconciliation comes not heartily, nor constantly into his Petition.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This is his love, these his desires; and next I shall present you with his Humility. <hi>The faith of presumptuous men is windy,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Fourthly, And yet he is not so farre dejected out of the sense of his baseness and unworthiness, that he growes desperare. Believe he will even above sense, and beyond reason. So it was with <hi>David,</hi>

                     <hi>The sorrows of death compassed me, and the paines of hell gat hold upon me; I found trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and sorrow. Then call'd I upon the Name of the Lord; O Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, deliver my soul.</hi> So it was with <hi>Job, Though he slay me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 13.15. Jonah 2.4.</note>
                     <hi>yet will I trust in him.</hi> So with <hi>Jonah, I am cast out of the sight of thy eyes, yet will I look toward thy holy Temple.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 15.21, &amp;c.</note> But above all in the woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> small comfort (God wot) she had; at the first Christ gave her ne're a word, the Disciples would have her sent away; Christ told her <hi>he was not sent to her; that it was not fit to take bread prepared for children, and cast it to Dogs;</hi> but she picks advantage out of that reproachful name, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, That Dogs might lick up the lost crummes; and why not she be fed with some crummes of mercy, though no better than a Dog?

                     <hi>against hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in hope, giving glory to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Lastly, When God is pleased to look up again, and shew the light of his countenance, and give that acclamation to their faith, that he did to the Woman of <hi>Canaan, Great is thy faith:</hi> Be it as thou desirest:<note place="margin">Mat. 15.28.</note> The soul takes more joy, delight, content in this, than all the delights of the world.

                  <hi>search the Scriptures, seek and ye shall finde?</hi> To seek and search is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, so it be done with discretion. Now that it be discreetly done, these three things are to be observ'd; <hi>Res, tempus, modus.</hi> In the thing we must know what to search for.<note place="margin">Tertul. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script. cap. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> About the time, when we are to search. And for the manner, how farre.</p>
               <p>The Summe of that Learned Fathers Discourse, is, That when we have attain'd the grounds, and are firmly built upon that foundation, <hi>of which Christ is the chief Corner-stone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 2.20.</note> being united by the holy Ghost; and after repaired and strengthened by the vertue of the Sacrament, that men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselves, and seek curiously, contentiously, maliciously no farther. <hi>Nobis curiositate opus non est post Christum, nec inquisitione post Evangelium;</hi> We need not curiosity after Christ, nor inquisition after the Gospel. To do other, is the practice of <hi>Athens,</hi> not <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> and what hath the wrangling Schoole to do with the Church? Our instructions and examples must be fetcht not from the <hi>Stoa</hi> of <hi>Socrates,</hi> but from <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch, whose direction is, <hi>Seek the Lord in simplicity of heart.</hi> Read the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but with sobriety. If any man upon presumption of his own wit, his own parts, either of Nature or Art, or (which is at this day pretended) Inspiration, or Revelation, seek farther than stands with the Rule of faith and peace of the Church: besides that this betrayes an evil heart, he shall be sure to cast himself into a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> out of which it will not be easie to get. <hi>Cum credimus, nihil desideramus ultra credere,</hi> when we once know our Creed,<note place="margin">Tertul. loc. co.</note> and believe it, we do not desire to search farther what to believe. For let a licentious liberty be granted to that, and then Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> will tell you what's like to come of it. <hi>Quanta um rixarum semen, &amp; futura est confusio, si prout cui{que} libitum est mutare liceat quae ad communem sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum pertinent!</hi> what seeds of Quarrels are sown, and how great will be the confusion, if, as every one list, he may change that which by grave and due consideration is established for the common state of the Church! What is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on will never please all; and therefore, saith he, There will never be an end of wrangling, if matters may be left indifferent to be determined by every mans private discretion.</p>
               <p>It is then a certain Argument of this naughtiness of heart, and a plaine Note of Infidelity, when men move every stone of the foundation. The use that I shall make of it, is,</p>
               <p>First, That we look to the heart, that this busie and malignant Infidelity lurk not there; that howsoever there may thoughts arise within, that would entice to this sinne, yet that they be repress'd, smother'd so soon as born. It is too much that they arise, for it discovers that the heart is evil; but if we cast a loving eye to them, nurse them up, and please our selves in them, it may bring us to that sinne out of measure sinful, Apostacy and hardness of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:200414:29"/> heart, that heavy judgement about which the Apostle gives us the Caveat. That which <hi>Erasmus</hi> confess'd of himself about the reading of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is as true in all contentions of Religion;<note place="margin">Erasm.

Ded.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong evils of contention in Religion, hath observed these four. First, That Religion and Faith, which of all other things ought to be most indubitate and certain, whiles it is questioned, beginneth to be doubted of: and discord in Religion nourisheth certain seeds of Atheism. Secondly,<note place="margin">Nazianzen.</note> As plants which are often removed, cannot take root and prosper; so points of Faith and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety being removed out of their old standing, or bended this and that way, begin to lose their reverence and stability in the souls of men. Thirdly, As in building, so in contention, one Opponent gain-saying another, plucketh down, what (by a common labour and consent) ought to be builded up. Fourthly, Lastly, As it is impossible to follow guides, whose backs are each to other, and their faces look a contrary way; so Gods people, whose right it is to be led by their spiritual guides in one beaten path of faith and godliness, beholding their leaders call them a contrary way, are with peril of their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation distracted, not knowing which way to take.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Psalm 10.11.</note> Hence we may learn not to please out selves with Atheistical thoughts, <hi>as if no eye saw them.</hi> For be it that we may smooth them over to men, yet God can see what is within. Though the Put-cases of the Church, do move their doubts as cunningly as <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate,<note place="margin">Naz. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, under a pretence forsooth to whet their wits, and tell us what may be said; yet God who searcheth the heart, knows that it is out of an evil intent; that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a practice against the Truth, proceeding from the spirit of contradiction;<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.15.</note> for did they search the Truth indeed, it would be in love.</p>
               <p>This practice though it come no farther than the heart, is yet open to his eye; for <hi>Caro &amp; Spiritus Dei res,</hi> Flesh and Spirit are both from God;<note place="margin">Tertul. de poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> the flesh from his hand, the soul from his breath; both are the works and goods of the same Lord; and therefore both, if both offend, equally offensive to the same Lord. When you come to plead with God, 'tis a great vanity to plead <hi>Ʋolui,</hi> I confess I intended it, but <hi>non feai,</hi> I never did it: for a thought passeth for an act before him; and the very desires, plots, intentions, are so many breaches of his Law.</p>
               <p>They may want many degrees of weight and haynousness in respect of man; for till man is hurt actually by them, to man they cannot be grievous: But as these thoughts are entertain'd, and harbour'd, and cherished within, to him they are as malicious, as if brought to act; and he will punish the soul no less for the plot, than the body for the act. For God is neither <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulator nec praevaricator suae perspicaciae,</hi> he will neither hide nor palliate what he sees; he knows the will is the principal in the sinne, and therefore the soul (of which this is a faculty) must needs be so much the more liable to the punishment, by how much it is more guilty of the fact. This I have premised, that we take heed to free our selves from this malignity of the heart in this sin, and every other as well as the body; That since there is a common Law to both, and a common guilt of both, and a common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder and Judge of both, and a common Trial for both, and a common paine for both, that both be aw'd by it. But especially the heart, because from that, as the Fountaine, flowes all the mischief. It is good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:200414:30"/> then that the Spirit of God so often gives, <hi>That we keep the heart, and cleanse it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, That we keep it; so counsels the wise <hi>Solomon, Keep thy heart with all diligence.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 4.23.</note> Set the Word of God upon it to look to it, <hi>ne effluat;</hi> for as oft as it breaks over that bank, it puts all in hazard and danger. Set the Law to hammer it, and break it, and bruise it, that it may be a broken and a contrite heart, and so a fit Sacrifice to God. Set the Gospel upon it to melt and soften it, that of a stony and stubborne, it may become a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, a submissive, a tender, a fleshy heart, a fit Vessel to receive the Oyl of mercy.<note place="margin">Psal. 51.17.</note> Set Repentance to work upon it, Confession to acknowledge what's amiss, deprecation to ask pardon for what's amiss, sorrow for what is past, care for the time to come, that it may be a new reformed heart, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and dead to sin, but quickned and alive to grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But notwithstanding all our care, it is not possible to keep it without filth; necessary it is that we cleanse it often. It is Prophetical coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, <hi>O Hierusalem, wash thy heart!</hi> It is Apostolical counsel also, <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your hearts you double-mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <note place="margin">Jer. 4.14. James 4.8.</note> If you purifie your braine, 'tis well; for the head is full of mischief and fancies; never more than now; and well it is that they be swept out; for such notions become not the mindes of well-meaning Christians. If you cleanse the hands 'tis well; I mean the outward man from impure acts: For actual wickedness dishonours our holy professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Would we wash our mouths too, 'twere not amiss, for they are very foul with Oaths, blasphemies and slaunders. But let no man think when he hath brought his thoughts to some other order, or his outward man to some civil conformity, that he is cleane enough, and washed sufficiently. For the altering of the braine may be but <hi>vertigo capitis;</hi> and the clensing of the hand, as the Pharisaical washings of Pots, and Cups, and other Brazen Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,<note place="margin">Mark 7.4, 8.</note> condemned by our Saviour. A washing away there must be, not only of certain notions in our braines, but of the affections of the heart. And an alteration, not in the face for shame, or in the feet for feare, or in the hand for fashion, but in the heart, arising out of the pollution that dwells in it, and a conscience of the naughtiness we know by it.</p>
               <p>For if we carry a heart about us, set upon evil; deceive others for a time we may, but shall at last be deceived our selves. Others we deceive carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the name of Christians,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.13.

Now so many wayes as we may be said to draw near and cleave to God, so many wayes we may be said to disjoyne and go from him. The first way that a man approacheth God, and adheres to him, is Faith; and the other is Love: For by Faith he believes that God is, and what he is; a wise, good, true, just, merciful Deity; and upon this contemplation he falls in love with him, and unites to him as near as he can, and desires to do his will; because he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that that God who is so wise, good, true, and just, will never set
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:200414:30"/> down any erroneous Law, nor command any foolish, naughty, or unjust a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and who is so merciful, will forgive, remit, and blot out his failings and imperfect services.

               <p>A mans life is a warfarre upon the earth; Christ is the General, and leads the Army; and all that have given up their names to Christ, are his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and bound to fight under his banner. From the Camp then this word is borrowed; and those that run away from their Captain and Colours, are of those Renegado's and Fugitives. This is done two manner of wayes; either in whole, or in part.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are guilty of this Apostacy in the highest Decree, who totally renounce, deny, and fall from Christ; of whom the Apostle spoke in the former Chapters; and of which especially, as I conceive here; For as the Jews were the first Converts, so were they the first Apostates. Many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations those Jews who receiv'd the Faith,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 2.14.</note> sustain'd of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen the Jews; There never being such a Jew to a Christian Jew, as a natural and apostate Jew. Those persecutions then of the obstinate incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Jews their Countrymen, was one great tentation to them. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother tentation was the perswasions they brought unto them out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to cleave unto the Law, and not to believe in Jesus the dead man. Besides there were many among them, who though they did not totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Christ, yet did teach them to Judaize, to receive the whole Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law, as well as the Gospel, bringing them back again to that Yoke, which they had been taught to cast off. This was to begin in the Spirit, and to end in the flesh. This was to evacuate Christ, and to fall from grace.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.3. Cap. 5.4.</note> And to this end the Apostle here gives them this Caveat, That neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, nor perswasions should so far prevaile with them, that they depart from the living God.</p>
               <p>For in parting from Christ, they must depart from the living God, since he was the Lord of life, nay life it self; <hi>I an the way, the truth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 14.6. John 6.54.</note>
                  <hi>and the life.</hi> Which the Disciples acknowledg'd; for Christ proposing the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>What? will you also go away?</hi> Quo? <hi>Whither shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.</hi> Totally then to renounce our Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, as <hi>Demas</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate did; or to Judaize, as did many at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> is to depart from the living God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is that sin out of measure sinful, and not many are guilty of it; but there is another kind of it, from which I cannot free very many who carry the Name of Christ. <hi>Arrius</hi> that denies the Deity of our Saviour; and <hi>Socinus</hi> that denies the ransome of his blood; In a word, all Hereticks that obstinately take from the verity,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.19. and cap. 4.1.</note> and all Scismaticks that rend and teare the unity of the Catholick Church, are in part revolters, and making shipwrack of a good conscience, do depart from the faith.</p>

They are not wrong'd when we charge them with that revolt, with which God charg'd the Jews, <hi>They have forsaken me the fountain of living water, and digg'd to themselves cisterns that will hold no water.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 2.13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Take heed therefore of Infidelity; for if you be guilty of this sin, there is neither true faith, nor true love in you. As this sin more or less increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and seizeth the heart, so more or less we depart from the living God. For the less you believe God, the less you will regard him; the less you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, the less you will love him; the less you love, the less you will trust him; the less you trust, the less you will obey him; and the less you obey, the further still you depart from God. Be it then a man be not guilty of an universal Apostacy, by which he doth obstinately and maliciously resist the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Acts 7.51.</note>
                  <hi>tread under foot the Son of God, and count the blood by which he was sanctified, an unholy thing.</hi> Yet so farre as he doth set himself to dis-esteem, or wilfully contradict any Article of the faith; yea, or come short of the Sincerity and Truth of the Gospel in his life and practice, so farre he may be said to have renounced the Faith, and departed from the living God.</p>
               <p>It is by God laid to the charge of the Church of <hi>Ephesus, that she had left her first love;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 2.4.</note> and yet it appeares that the revolt was not Total. That which Christ had against her, was, a decay, a cooling, a defect in her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Her love was not so earnest, so constant, so hot as it was at first. The very cooling in Religious duties that brings a man to <hi>stagger</hi> in the faith, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretative,<note place="margin">Isa. 29.9.</note> a revolt from God.</p>
               <p>To this the Devil labours to bring men; first he tempts to doubt, then to dispute; well knowing that doubts and disputes may possibly forme the understanding to a new-belief. Like <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> that meerly at first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Arguments that the snow was not white, intending only to oppose Sophists, at last came to think so indeed. In the like manner, when a man sets his wits awork to discredit principles, by little and little thoughts steale upon him that they are false indeed, and bring him to the next step to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatize and Revolt from the living God.</p>

The other Interpretation is,<note place="margin">

                  </note> for I hope to make it evident, that there is not such another forgetful creature as man. For he needs a Remembrancer to put him in minde what he was, what he is, and what he may be. That he was a creature framed by God, the sole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after his Image.<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26, 27. John 8.44.</note> A creature transformed by sinne to the image of the devil; that he may be happy or unhappy as he believes, or dis-believes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyes or disobeyes his Maker. Thus much hath God recorded in his Book with the point of a Diamond; but men have not eyes to read it; or if read, not to heed it; or if heeded for the present, yet as a shadow before night it is behinde, past, forgotten; call'd upon men must be, and call'd upon often; and therefore the Apostle calls upon us to call upon them.</p>
               <p>Exhortation is of excellent use; for by it we may be rooted in faith and obedience; And it seems in the Primitive Church it was so necessary,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.8.</note> that some were to attend about it. He that Exhorts, let him wait upon Exhortation.</p>

               <p>At this day we live to see many breaches, many ruines in Religion; and these cracks and flaws, these dilapidations have proceeded from no other cause, save from the folly and deceitful dealing of the Exhorters. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation by them was never honestly laid, and no marvail then if their work is of so tottering a disposition. To day a Papist, to morrow an Anabaptist, the next day a Brownist, the fourth an Enthusiast; sometimes a Presbyter, and shortly after an Independent, and at last a Neuter, or an Atheist. I dare say't, and I know what I speak, let a maine part of the giddy-headed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude be examined upon the fundamental points,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.1.</note>
                  <hi>viz. Repentance from dead works, and faith toward God,</hi> and they who stand high in their own conceit, will be found no less ignorant than that people who in the Saints judgement <hi>know not the Law, and are accursed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">John 7.49.</note>This can be imputed to nothing else, but that they who have taken upon them to be chief Exhorters and Master-workmen, have shaped their work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fashion of the time, neglecting wholly to lay the foundation truly and soundly. <hi>But in the beginning it was not so. Theophilus, Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 1.4. Act 18.15. 2 Tim. 3.15.</note>
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> were all Catechized. And the Churches of <hi>Galatia, Carthage, Hippo, Alexandria,</hi> had respectively in them <hi>Pantenus, Clemens, Origen, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius, Augustine, Optatus</hi> set a part to that Office.</p>
               <p>The Christians had this way of Exhortation in great reputation from the beginning,<note place="margin">Prov. 22.6.</note> and the Jewes before them. <hi>Traine up a childe in the way that he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it. Traine up,</hi> saith the Text; <hi>Catechise,</hi> saith the margent, according to the natural force of the Hebrew word <hi>Chanach,</hi> that signifies to enter or initiate. And <hi>Sepher Chinnuch,</hi> the Book of Institutions; <hi>i. e.</hi> a Catechism, is a Book well known among the Jewes in every place where they are known. Were babes in Christ carefully fed with such milk as this, that is fit (I had almost said only for the tender age) they would grow to be perfecter and sounder men in Religion, and never prove such deformed, such misshapen, such diseased creatures as now they do.</p>
               <p>'Tis not my meaning that men inclose and circumscribe their thoughts in Catechistical rudiments, but before they soare higher, I would have them skilfull in these first.<note place="margin">Heb. 6.1.</note> The Apostle puts upon us this progress, <hi>Learn the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the doctrine of Christ, and go on to perfection.</hi> Not to leave at them,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.18.</note> but not to leave them out; that we endeavour to encrease in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but first make sure of the foundation.

               <p n="3">3. To go a step farther, when an eye hath been had to the matter of the Exhortation, and a regard to the persons, heed must be taken to the manner or method we proceed by; it must not have its rise either from deceit,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 2.3, 4.</note> or uncleanness, or guile; the Apostle renounceth it; Our Exhortation was not of deceit, not of uncleanness, not of guile.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is uncleanness. There were a generation of <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 2.15.</note> whose impurity was hateful to our Saviours soul: And if there be any of that posterity alive, who exhort that all things be common, let them perish with their Exhortation. But as for guile, it ought not once to be named by a professor of Truth; It is too Serpentine and devilish to speak Roses, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still poyson. All Exhorters are but Trustees of the Gospel; and they truly discharge their trust, when they exhort sincerely, <gap reason="foreign">

These then and the like forms of speech, and the commands laid upon us by them, binde the conscience only habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; that all negligence and satiety laid aside, we have a ready disposition of minde and will, to pray, to give thanks, to rejoyce, to exhort at all hours and seasons, so farre forth as we shall be called upon. To omit the other duties, I shall insist upon this only: And that you exhort one another the more readily without intermission, I shall quicken you with these four reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Food for the soul is as necessary as nourishment for the body. Thus much the Oratour could teach us,<note place="margin">Cic. de Senect.</note>
                  <hi>Non solum subveniendum corpori, sed men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti &amp; animo multo magis, &amp;c.</hi> We may not only cherish and feed the body, but the mind and understanding much more; for this is like a Lamp, into which if you instil not oyle, it will go out. His oyle was Moral precepts, ours is a more pure,<note place="margin">John 6.32, 33, &amp;c.</note> sublime, and heavenly material. 'Tis the bread that came down from thence, 'tis the milk that God hath provided for Babes, the meat allotted for strong men and Travellers.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.2. Heb. 5.12.14.</note> He, the Heathen knew they could not spare theirs; and we Christians must not think to live without ours. As that Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of our body (for such it is, and so esteeme it) will quickly down, if it be not staid up with the staffe of bread:<note place="margin">Ezra 4.16.</note> So also your better part which sojourns in this Tabernacle, will starve and die except it have a daily supply of spiritual food. I appeal to your own breasts; how quick, how lively, how couragious have you been to a duty after an exhortation! how resolute to withstand a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation after a sad admonition, what Votaries I had almost said against it. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I have seene those that are mighty to pour in strong drink,<note place="margin">Isa. 5.11, 22.</note> after the Wo denounced, and an exhortation to sobriety, either to forbear their riot, or to decline the house and company,<note place="margin">Chrysost. Hom. <hi>1.</hi> de Lazar.</note> or at least not to frequent it, or if drawn sometimes aside, yet to sit there unwillingly, to drink unpleasantly; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the exhortation giving a check to every glasse, and taking off the former accustomed delight. I see that <hi>Solomons</hi> words will prove true; <hi>The words of the wise are as goads and nails.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 12.11.</note> Goads to quicken a slow
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:200414:35"/> beast to work, and nails to fasten him, that he fall not from his work; and all exhorters, whether by Office, or out of charity, are the Masters of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation that handle them, and drive them home, to the utter removal and exclusion of an impudent hard heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For in that lies the danger (from which I draw my second reason) For neglect this duty, and your heart of flesh may be turned into an heart of stone; (and what that is, and the danger of it, I shall by and by open unto you) against which fearful judgement daily exhortation is a soveraign Antidote.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nusquam scouritas,</hi> brethren; we walk in a dangerous way.<note place="margin">Bern.</note> The Angels could not be secure in heaven: Not <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, and shall we now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be secure on earth? Every day our feet may slip, and therefore we ought to take heed every day, lest we catch a fall. Be it we were, which few of us are, burning and shining Lamps; yet know we must, that we are <hi>sub Dio,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 5.35.</note> not in <hi>domo,</hi> we are abroad in the open are, and then it behoves us with both hands to keep in the light, not to trust over-much to the aire, though it seeme never so still and quiet.

But we live, as I said, <hi>sub Dio,</hi> and that little light we have is exposed to the fury of three most impetuous winds; The Divel which blusters about us,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8.

                     </gap>sh</hi> that sets upon us within; that I say not how we are subject to wasting, to fainting, to weaknesse, to a secret decay of our selves, had we no other enemy. Therefore with both hands, with that of our own, with that of our neighbours, let care be taken that this light be kept in. <hi>My soul,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119.109.</note>
                  <hi>is in my hand;</hi> As a canndle carried betwixt both hands, possible to be extinguished: And yet as a candle betwixt two hands to be looked to, preserv'd, covered with all possible diligence.</p>
               <p>And every day this lesson would be ingeminated and said over, that every man hath a soul, a soul in danger, a soul in danger to be-stiffned and hardned; and when stiffned and hardned, that it can receive no impression of the Spirit; and he that hath not that impresse, belongs not to God. All which inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by assiduous and dayly exhortation may be prevented.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Adde to this, that possibly he that exhorts another may be much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it;<note place="margin">Dan 12.3:</note> I speak not of the reward we shall have at the hands of God (though I know it shall be very great, farre beyond the merit of so slight a work) but his knowledge by this will be much improved, and his deadnesse to a duty quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

               <p>No way so easie, to attain perfection in any Art as instruction of the ignorant. One Flint struck against another grows hot and sparkles, and a dull Knife whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by another becomes sharper: The way then to be perfect scholars,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.7.</note> is <hi>acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo haec,</hi> to rehearse, and by rehearsing to sharpen, and whet the doctrine of Christ one upon another.

               <p>These reasons I have added <hi>ex super abundanti,</hi> over and above, to quicken you to this duty. But yet there be three more, of more validity, than any thing that I can say, because they are the reasons of the Text. The first drawn from the Opportunity and Time that God hath given to do it.

               <p n="3">3. Sinne is a notable Sophister, and is apt to put a fallacy upon us; A deceitfulness is in it. If then you mean not to answer for your neglect of time,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.3. Job 14.14. 1 Cor. 7.29. Psal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But the first were disobedient, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond provoked him; and the first perished by water, and the carkasses of the other perished in the Wilderness.

These who have heard him speak now, shall be heard then; but to those who in this their day, have with the deaf Adder stopped their cares, he will, though they call, give no pleasing answer.

               <p>Time and opportunity doth very much facilitate whatsoever is difficult. It hath its <hi>Articulos,</hi> its Articles, and as it were joynts; if you hit upon them, the work is done with much case; but if mistaken, much labour may be bestowed to little purpose. In their season the principles of Arts may be learned, which being let slip, known it is by lamentable experience, they will not be obtained; or if ever, yet not so perfectly, not with ease. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this circumstance hath with wise men ever carried the force of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Saint <hi>Peter, Job,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who not have serv'd themselves of it? and <hi>David</hi> prayes to God to be taught this first point in Arithmetick, <hi>O teach me to number my dayes.</hi> Now that what I perswade about it, may come the warmer to your hearts, weigh the several reasons that may move you to make use of this your day.</p>
               <p>First, It is but short; which is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> reason, <hi>This I say, because the day is short.</hi> Those who have but a little light to bring them to bed, hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band it as thriftily as they may; and since we have but (as I may so say) a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles end of life to lay us in our beds of dust, we ought to be thrifty of it. Your time, you may see here and elsewhere, is not measur'd out to you by ages, by years, by months, by dayes, but by a single day,<note place="margin">Luke 19.22. 2 Cor. 6.2. Acts 17.31.</note> which at the longest is of no great continuance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But grant that we presume it long, yet it is of a fluent nature, alwayes in motion, wasting, and consuming still; the more spent, the less be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde. It is like oyle in the Lamp, or Wine in the Vessel,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note> that dayly grows less and worse. This houre then omitted, is an houre lost;<note place="margin">Gen. 7. Heb. 3. Verse 17. Jonah 3.10.</note> and this day neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, is a day irrecoverable; so much at least thou art cast behind in this great Work.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Yea, and which is farther to be thought on also, this may be the last day for ought thou knowest. God may call for thy soul this night.<note place="margin">John 9.4.</note> The Sun knows his houre to set, <hi>and the Moon her time of going down;</hi> but man knows not when his Lamp of life will go out; for death doth not arrest men,<note place="margin">Isa. 61.2. Joel 2.2.</note> and lay them up in the prison of their grave according to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niority, age, and standing. A young <hi>Josiah</hi> dyes, as well as an old <hi>Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selah.</hi> When you see bubbles dancing upon the face of the stream, you behold men, of which some swell higher, some are less,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.28. Ezek. 14.14.</note> but all after they have fetcht a few frisks and turnes, fall flat into a sheet of water, and those into a sheet for the earth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What should I say, that grant a longer day be given,<note place="margin">Jer. 15.1.</note> and a man deferr'd till the Almond Tree do flourish, yet it will be nor wisdome, nor gratitude to deferre the Exhortation, or not to lend an ear to it, or obey it till then. First, No wisdome;<note place="margin">Zach. 13.1.</note> for what man that is in his right minde travelling on the way, and having store of lusty and able beasts, would let them all go empty, and lay all his pack and whole carriage upon some poor, leane, and infirme Jade that is scarce able to carry himself, much less the Pack, the Load that is cast upon him?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.2.</note> And surely no less unreasonable is that man, who passing away over idly the able and lusty dayes of his youth, packs all the labour and travel for his soul upon his impotent old age,<note place="margin">Eccles. 3.1.</note> whose infirmities are so many and so troublesome, that they weary him of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, though you reckon not the weight of this burden. Secondly,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.11, 12.</note> But to let this pass, what ingratitude and injustice is this to our good God, who hath lent us our time, to set out the least, the last, the worst part of our life unto his service?

To him thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lottest a little, short, niggardly pittance of thy old age; but to thy own lusts and pleasures on whom thou hast cast thy love, the greatest, the fairest, the fullest measure that can be; <hi>a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 6.38.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Oh unequal dealing! O extreame ingratitude! What reason is there that God should be thus used at our hands? what equity? that having spent in the service of lust the flower of youth, thou dish out to him thy old diseased bones? that his enemies have the best, and he the leavings? they the Wine, and he the dregs? as if a man had learn'd his Lesson of the Traveller in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, that eat up all the Kernels and Almonds, and presented the rines and shells to his God.<note place="margin">Levit. 3.16.</note> Dost thou not remember that in his Sacrifice his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the fat? the best part? follow then the counsel of the holy Ghost gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Solomon, Remember thy Creatour in the dayes of thy youth, before the evil days come,</hi>

               <p>You have heard the Apostles first reason, why you should be active in this Duty; and why also they who are exhorted, should take their day and do their work in it.

               <p>The Jewes were a zealous people; zealous of the Law of their fathers, zealous for the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and this hear of zeal was so great, that it stiffned their necks and their hearts so much,<note place="margin">Acts 22.3.21.20.</note> that the Truth of the Gospel could make no impression upon them, say the Prophets, say Christ, say the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles what they could, they still remained blinde, obstinate, stiff, stubborn, as good mollifie a stone.

               <p>But sometimes again this hardness is wrought through abundance of cold, too much earthliness, which so cools and freezeth all motions of the spirit, that the heart is no way softened by them. <hi>Achans</hi> wedge of gold, <hi>Shechem</hi> and <hi>Hamors</hi> substance,<note place="margin">Josh. 7.21.

               <p>Now out of these excessive fits of heat and cold, ariseth that cauterized con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science the Apostle speaks of, which makes it past feeling;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.2.</note> which is peculiar first to Hereticks, such as give eare to seducing spirits, and doctrines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, that speak lyes in hypocrisie.

               <p>And how heavie this judgement is, will manifestly appear, if we shall take a view of these three. 1. The <hi>Time</hi> when it is inflicted. 2. The <hi>Agents</hi> in it. 3. And the <hi>persons</hi> upon whom it is brought.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A time there is for the heart to be melted, softned, mollified: It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>to Day</hi> in this place, when God offers a pardon, and useth all means to make men capable of it; he sues to us by the ministry of the Word, that it might be accepted. And this his request he seconds with intreaties, expostulations, lamentations, commiserations, and all other strains of Rhetorique, that are apt to move affections, and prevail with men to draw them nearer unto him.

At last finding that he hath to deale with a stone, that he speaks to a stone, beats upon a stone, which no hand is able to make sensible, he gives over calling, expecting, waiting, striving, smiting, and leaves the heart as he found it, hard, stubborne, rebellious, obstinate, and contumacious.<note place="margin">Mat. 23.32. Exod. 9.12.</note> And then the man fills up the measure of his iniquities, upon which destruction infallibly follows, <hi>Josh.</hi> 11.20.</p>
               <p>God hardens <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart. But when was it? not till a fair intreaty to let his people go, not till the plague of Froggs, and swarms of Flyes, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance of Lice, nor Murrain of the Cattle were able to soften him. Upon this God sends another plague, that of boyles and blaines, and then 'tis said, and not before, in a new stile, <hi>the Lord hardned the heart of Pharaoh,</hi> as upon one that was ripe for destruction,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Of late or death-bed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Sect. 14. <hi>Obfirmatum est cor Pharaonis.</hi> Jun.</note> and one upon whom he would pour all his plagues. True it is that we read, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.21. by way of prediction or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, <hi>I will harden Pharaohs heart;</hi> but that was not yet done; and again in our Translation, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.13. <hi>He hardned Pharaohs heart,</hi> but that is a mistake, for the words do not bear that in the Hebrew, but thus, <hi>Pharaohs heart waxed strong,</hi> or hard, or was hardned; it is passively, not actively to be understood. Gods time of hardning was not yet come; Then he did it, and not till then, when nor a fair and mild request, nor four or five sharper blows could soften him. The like is to be observed of <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> of those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that God destroyed utterly. Of the ten Tribes;<note place="margin">Deut. 2.30. Josh. 11.20. 2 Kings 17.14. 2 Chron. 36.3. Rom. 11.7, 8, 9.</note> Of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his heart, and stifned his neck from turning to the Lord God of <hi>Israel.</hi> And of the whole Nation of the Jews, who were broken off, rejected, and at this day dispersed. The precedent of their ruine was an obduration and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse; and this fell not upon them, till all means that might soften them were slighted, and would not be heard. The time then that makes men ripe for this judgement, and the consequent of it, may be one strong retentive to keep men from it. Exhort, that you be not hardned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if the time when it is inflicted, move you not, then next look upon the Agents about it. First, I shall name a just God.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.18.</note>

                     </gap> hardneth.</hi> And when I called him just, I made an Apology for this his Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for he hardneth no mans heart, before the man himself hath first hardned it. Some precedent iniquity there is, which might procure God in his justice
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:200414:38"/> and anger to deny his mercy, or take away the mollifying grace of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. God often punisheth sinne with sinne, and makes the future iniquity to be the revenge of the former. It is easie to collect this out of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Wherefore God gave them up to beleeve a lye, because they changed the Truth of God into a lye.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1.24. 2 Thes. 2.11, 12.</note> It was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a just recompence of their former errour. Hardnesse of heart is not only a punishment, but a sin, and as a sinne it hath disorder, obliquity, deformity in it, and so God cannot be the proper cause of it; but look upon it as it is a just recompence of some foregoing wickednesse, and then it is certainly true that the justice of heaven hath a very great hand in it. Farther yet, this obduration, when attributed to God, is no work of his properly, nor act of infusion, or positive producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for he puts no hardnesse into the heart, no malice into the affections: But his approaches of mercy being slighted, he withdraws, affords his grace no longer, which should mollifie the heart, and then the heart returnes to its own hardness and malice; no otherwise than wax, which stiffness so soon as the heat of the fire, hand, or sun, that did soften it, is removed from it.</p>
               <p>For that I may give you a clearer light in this matter, the immediate, nearest, and truest cause of this hardness, is man himself. In whose heart there is a double malignity, <hi>Innata, &amp; adaucta,</hi> Born with him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing upon him. The first is innate, some call it natural, and God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to remove it from all the Vessells of mercy, <hi>I will take away their heart of stone, and give them a heart of flesh.</hi> Before then a man be born againe this stony heart was in him,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.</note> otherwise it could not be taken away. The other is humane and voluntary, when a man wilfully grows stubborne, and perverse, and will not by the still voice of mercy, nor thunder of judgement, be drawn to yield or submit. Now the Agents that encrease and heighten it, is first by accident, the Admonition, Exhortation, Commination of any man of God, sent to mollifie such a soule. <hi>Go</hi> (saith God to his Prophet) <hi>and blind their eyes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 6.10.</note> That which should have been for their wealth, through their own default is an occasion of falling;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.16.</note>
                  <hi>the Gospel ordain'd for life, the savour of death unto death.</hi> Then the Devil takes his advantage; and as he findes the heart enclined, works to the greater hardening of it. <hi>The Devil put into the heart of Judas to betray him.</hi> And because he knows there is no readier instrument for such a purpose than a false Prophet,<note place="margin">John 13.2.</note> therefore he makes choice of him to be his under Agent. <hi>I will go, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 22, 22.</note> and this lye was so efficacious, that it deceiv'd <hi>Ahab,</hi> hardned him to go up against <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> to his destruction. This the devil himself thought was a way that could not faile. Lastly, Sinne is an Agent also in this work; or to speak more properly with our Apostle, <hi>the deceitfulnesse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.11.</note>
                  <hi>the delusion, the cunning, the Sophistry of it:</hi> Of which more by and by.</p>
               <p>Lay all this together. That God hardens in anger and justice, his grace being withdrawn. That the heart is suffered to returne <hi>ad ingenium,</hi> to that natural disposition of a stone. That the Ministry of the Word rejected en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth it; That the Devil and the false Prophet are great Agents in it; That sinne is the Sophist that perswades unto it: And then consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all meanes be not to be used, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Even charity that is kinde, and judgeth the best cannot be so blinde, as of these not to suspect the worst. Look upon these then, and learne to heare God, his voice, his Word, his Spirit, his Ministers, whose labour it is to melt, to mollifie you, to form your stony heart into a heart of wax, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of such impressions as must be sealed upon you, if ever you intend to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his rest.

                  <hi>as in the day of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation in the Wilderness.</hi> For this is <hi>to grieve the Spirit, by whom you must be sealed</hi> (if ever) <hi>to the day of Redemption.</hi> This is to quench the fire of the Spirit, which alone can melt out your dross. This is to do despite to the Spirit of grace, when he is about to change your heart. And upon this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance given to him, and this quench cast upon him, and this despite done him, he will be gone, and then you left in a sad condition. For then God will harden, the Devil will harden, the Gospel will harden, and sinne will harden your heart; God out of justice and revenge, the Devil out of malice, the Gospel by accident for your unbelief, and Sinne by collusion and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. To which pitch when an obdurate sinner is come, he is set upon the brink of hell; and if he be saved out of the flame, it must be by as strange a preservation, as <hi>Lot</hi> was saved from the fire of <hi>Sodome,</hi> when the Angel took him, and his wife,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.16.</note> and his daughters by the hand (the Lord being merciful unto him) and deliver'd him from that fire and brimstone.</p>
               <p>But because among these Agents, the Apostle here singles out one as a chief actor in it, and withal acquaints us with the way by which it works, to wit, not by force and power, but by Art and slye practices, I shall in the last place speak a word of those, and give you warning about them, that you be not taken by the fallacy.

Not the least syllable all this while of the Hook that was conceal'd, till the cunning An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler had catch'd his prey, then they confess'd that they were both couzened. <hi>The woman deceived me,</hi> saith the man; <hi>The Serpent deceived and beguiled me,</hi>

Thirdly, That in the worship and service of God nothing may be retain'd, but what was in use in the Apostles dayes. Lastly, Those few and innocent Rites which we plead for now, are Popish, Anti-Christian, Scandalous. This is the method which these Impostours proceed by; and when they meet with weak understandings, they prove very powerful to deceive; yea, and to harden the heart also in the deceit.</p>

The men were before (as you now are) full of youth, full of courage, full of valour, that durst have entertain'd any sin; but then the strangest object of pity, of discomfort, of weakness, that ever eye beheld.

For your comfort, then to a pricked, tender, bleeding soul, I dare promise the grace of Repentance; but to the hard and impenitent I cannot.

                  <hi>the bruised;</hi> there is not one stubborne person among them. Take it for a Rule, If Christ heale the broken-hearted, then broken-hearted they must be before he can heale them; what is your heart whole? as hard as the nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mill-stone? then are you not for his care. In all Christs dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, there is not a medicine for such a heart, no balm in <hi>Gilead</hi> for such a sore.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rabbins</hi> truly teach us, That the heart may be broken from sin, and for sinne. From sinne comes all afflictions and crosses, which give the heart a mighty blow, but this is no kindly hammer. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart was broken with Ten plagues, but I know not how it did congeale againe, and was as hard if not harder than ever before. Then the heart is truly broken, when it is batter'd to pieces for sinne, when it beholds sinne with all its proportions and flatteries, and hates it, because it is odious to God, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive to his Majesty, a dishonour unto his Holinesse, and so great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of his anger, that no lesse Sacrifice could appease his Wrath, and Reconcile us to him, than the Blood of his Deare Sonne poured out upon the accursed Tree. This, this thought alone is able to melt the stonyest heart, that stubbornely and wilfully it should go on to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke so merciful a Father, so kinde a Redeemer, and so present a Comforter: That by no exhortations or admonitions, it should be won from the deceits of sin.</p>
               <p>Remember this houre, I have told you of it, and lay it to heart; it may perhaps turne back your heads, and in time break you off from presumptuous Wickednesse. That's my aime, that's my desire, that you may once at last break with your lusts. And the Lord so mollifie and soften your hearts, that the hammer of his Law may in time barter you, and the fire of his Gospel may so melt you, that you tremble at his Justice and Judgements, and believe and embrace his mercies and promises.

               <p>In this Chapter <hi>Moses</hi> sets out to us the story of the Creation of the whole world. Teaching us that it was not eternal, but that it had a beginning in time. Thus the record begins <hi>In principio,</hi>

This is an act of omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and therefore in the <hi>Creed</hi> we give him this attribute, Almighty. That which is thus produced, is summed up in both places under the name of <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth.</hi> In heaven we are taught, there are the spheres, the starres, the two great lights, with the Angelical powers, which have their seats therein. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Moone, then the elements, birds, beasts, fishes, trees, plants, minerals, men; There be visible, there be invisible creatures, some below, some above, and God Almighty is the maker of all these.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Moses</hi> though he only names the generals, as fowles, fishes, herbs, cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and creeping things, yet he tells us, that they <hi>were made after their kinde,</hi> in such or such a species; and then they must have of necessity somewhat that internally doth specificate them, and put an essential difference betwixt kinde and kinde, which can be nothing else but the forme, it being the property of that to give being, distinction, and operation to every kinde. And so he hath led us by the hand to the Formal cause also.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, he opens to us the final cause, <hi>viz.</hi> That all these creatures were made for Man.<note place="margin">Verse 28, 29.</note> He to be the Lord, and have dominon over all; all given to him for his use, for his enjoyment; yet so, that he returne God his tribute of glory.

His Word, the Scripture, is open only to those of his family; but his works, Heaven and Earth, and the creatures in both, is a Book in Folio, open to all the world, wherein the most unletter'd man may perceive there is a God.

                  <p>For the old part of this Record they, the Jewes I mean, and yet preserve, have deliver'd it unto us. This together with the New, the Catholick Church of God hath stooped unto as the revealed Will of God. And this must needs be a strong inducement devoutly and diligently to read it, and reverently to esteem it; with which the more we consult, the more we shall be perswaded that it came from God: There is in the Edicts so much Majesty, in the Pen-men so much Unity and Harmony, in the Truth so much constancy, in the Doctrine so much equity and purity. Had it proceeded from the corrupt fountaine of mans braine, either the flatness of the stile, or the jarring of the writers, or the inconstancy of the materials, or the injustice or impurity of the Rules contained in it, would too rankly have savoured of flesh and blood. That I name not those strange predictions (which had their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement in their season) contain'd in it; and those high and sublime Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations so farre beyond the reach of man to invent, that they are not believed when Taught. Could a Natural man be the Authour of that, which as yet no Natural man is able by the strength of reason to comprehend?</p>
                  <p>Farther yet, even Nature it self hath ingraffed in every mans soul a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be happy. To which all the directions of men are unsufficient, because
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:200414:44"/> they never yet could finde out a meanes fully to content and satisfie Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for one sinne. Necessary then it was, that man who was ordained to, and desires to attaine happiness, should have some supernatural help to bring him to it, since all natural was too weak. This we call the revealed Will of God, without which the desire of the soul will be frustrate. And once let it be granted that Revelation is necessary, and then one of these two will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; That there never was any such Revelation; which will frustrate the intentions of God for mans felicity: Or that the Word of God which we now embrace, is that Revelation, since there is no other extant.</p>
                  <p>To close up this Digression, I shall offer one thing more only, which will be a stong perswasion that this is the Book of God, and that it came not from any private impulsion. Every man is so great a flatterer of himself, and so jealous of his own honour, that were it possible, he would not suffer the least of his infirmities to appeare, much less his foulest enormities to be blazon'd to posterity. But the Secretaries of this Book have not concealed their grossest faults,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. Num. 12. &amp; 20. Psalm. 51. Jonah 1. &amp; 4. 1 Tim. 1.13.</note> nor their friends impurest actions. <hi>Moses,</hi> not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers errours, nor his own, no nor <hi>Aarons</hi> his own brothers transgressions; <hi>David</hi> in a Throne mournes, yet expresseth his adultery, and murder of <hi>Ʋ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah; Jonah</hi> Book'd his shameful flight, and his sullen anger, his impatience; <hi>Paul</hi> mentions his cruel persecution of the Church, and was content to have it set out at large by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> also his perjury and denial of his Master by the Evangelists. Since then these pious soules either wrote themselves their own blemishes, or being written by others, suffered not an <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> to pass upon them; a mighty evidence it is, That there was a motion more than humane that thus disposed them to write, and to beare with what was written.</p>
                  <p>To what purpose you will say, is all this? to what else, but to perswade you, or rather all Infidels, that the Scripture is the revealed Will of God? And then it will necessarily follow, that there is a God before he can reveal any thing, which was the Point to be proved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Were we to convince a <hi>Mahometan</hi> in this question, we could be copious in proofs out of the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> were we to undertake a Jew, a <hi>Saducee,</hi> a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> we could convince them either out of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or <hi>Talmud.</hi> Had we a dispute with some wise Heathen, we could serve our selves of infinite Testimonies from their own Writings. Our Task is then the more difficult, because being to deal with men, who would be held, and are in their own eyes the sole ingrossers and Monopolists of reason, yet to wise men seem most irrational.

Suppose you beheld a man commit some heynous sinne securely and secretly, and perswading himself that there is nor Judge nor Revenger; at that instant let but death appeare, and hold up his finger, his countenance is chang'd, his knees smite together, his heart becomes cold as a stone.

In their prosperity confess God they will not, lest they should feare him;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:200414:45"/> but the least feare extorts from them a free confession. And because they would not feare God that made all things,<note place="margin">Psalm 53.5. <hi>Sueton.

No eye sees thee, no face beholds thee, all's done in secret, and the night dwells upon thy actions. There are no passions; heaven is a fable, and hell a Tale; there is neither Angel, nor Spirit, nor yet Gods: or if any, they take their rest and ease above, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not any thing that is here done below; Fate and Necessity alone beare the sway in all things, and dost thou yet tremble? are thou yet pale? dost thou yet flye and hide? Well, now I see that guilt makes thee a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and danger creates feare, and feare creates Gods. That little spark of the Deity, which thy looser course of life hath raked up for a time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes to glow in a time of trouble, presents to thy conscience a Judge, a Tribunal, a fearful Sentence.

First, eminently, when those perfections which are in the creature mount our thoughts to the Creator, and warrant us to affirme, that if they be honorable in the effect, they must needs be of far more veneration in the cause. We know that God cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Substance and Accidents, but whatsoever is in God, is God; and therefore we should call him, <hi>in abstracto,</hi> justice, mercy, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, power it self, and not just, merciful, good, omnipotent. 'Tis then by Analogy this is done; and from the similitude of a finite object every way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to our weak understanding, we attribute to God those vertues in which the creature doth excel. We hold it an honour to a man to be wise, just, good, holy, merciful, &amp;c. and therefore we conceive it will make for his glory to acknowledge, that he is wise in his counsels, just in his proceedings, good in benefits, holy in his wayes, merciful in his forbearance. Eminent in all these, and paramount, infinitely beyond the perfections of the best man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The way we come to know God from the creature, is Negatively, by which we remove from him all those defects and imperfections which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

'Tis not therefore for him who hath an unlimited essence to be stinted by our eye or minde; 'tis not for him, who is life it self, or <hi>in whom is no shadow of change,</hi> to be subject to mortality and alteration. Leave all these defects to mortal, mutable, and weak men; and therefore that we may be sure to remove them far enough from him, we have chosen to expresse our selves in these Negative Epithets.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:200414:46"/> For we never see any effect, but presently we enquire after the cause; we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver behold a thing, but strait we enquire who did it.

Hence it is that those higher orbes have not run to ruine, nor needed any reparation from the first erection. Look upon the form, and then how spacious, how glorious is it?

And the glory so clear, that every orbe is as glasse dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous, and gives leave to the eye to see those higher and brighter lamps in the eighth wheele, whose light indeed seemes to us to shake into quicker rayes, because our eyes are too weak to behold it. Yet all these are but seconds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent candles that must borrow their light, their glory from the fountain of light, the Sun, whose splendour is so fiery and radiant,<note place="margin">Job. 31.26, 27.

                     <p>I fear me, I have staid you too long in these lower roomes; will you but ascend a little, and take your prospect into the three stories of the aire?

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:200414:47"/> againe as airy furnaces to vomit out fire and lightnings not without thunder and amazement. Another while they resemble steel glasses, wherein the Sun looks and shews his face in all the colours of the Rainebow. Here are streams of light, blazing and falling Meteors, fires darted up and down in many formes, besides those hideous openings, and as it were, gulfes of the sky, the woolly snow, and the stony haile. In the lower room of this thinner body, those boystrous windes that breath from the Caves of the earth exercise their dominion, and act like Tyrants; Their sound we heare, and their force we feele, yet we can neither see their substance, nor well know their cause; whence, and what they are, and whither they passe,<note place="margin">John 3.8.</note> God alone knows.</p>
                     <p>And that man should not pass away his time in a melancholy and dumpish manner, the Creatour hath provided several sorts of musique to content him; Those winged Musicians of the aire build and sit, and sing at our doors, the tongue of many birds being as as instrument of musique to please the ear. Some with a loud voice, others with a still; one humming as it were the Base, another chanting the Treble; this holding the plaine song, while the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale sings descant and division, in that sweetness that no Art of man can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, I had almost said imitate. That I mention not those little round beds, and pretty Cradles prepared for their little ones, so artificially composed, and yet according to their several kindes framed, inlay'd, and stuft, that mans hand though it can do strange things, yet is not able to dispose in such order the sticks, the wooll, the haire, the moss, the morter. What is it that taught them this Harmony, this Architecture, if chance, it would not be constant, and alwayes the same; If sence, why then is it not common to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?

Or if this may not be imagined,<note place="margin">Fr. Thamara de las Costum de todas las gentes lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note> then surely nature taught them. But if so, then why are not words naturally significant? why do not men by nature speak? why are they mute if not taught?

                     <p>The other part of man is his body, in the frame of which, Physicians and Anatomists confess so many parts, so many miracles. Whence is the hardness of the bones? whence that red juice that flows in the veines? whence are those vital, those animal spirits? whence is that retentive, that concoctive, that expulsive faculty? whence came those sinks to convey away what would obstruct and kill, the gall for choler, the spleen for melancholy, the bladder for urine, the belly for excrements? whence is that continual and musical time of the pulse, actuated by the spirits, to quicken the blood that it cool not, and drive it on that it stay not? All these are wonders. O man, thou neither canst make these in thy self, nor yet <hi>Galen</hi> or <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in thee. And therefore know and acknowledge, that all these with infinite more flow from a superiour cause. And because thou understandst, he must understand much more; and because thou art a voluntary Agent, he must much more do what he will: If thou be quick, active, and infinite in thy conceptions, he must farre more exceed in his thoughts; there can be nothing excellent in thee, which is not super-eminent in him who is <hi>Jehova</hi> the eternal God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for ever and ever.</p>

The water poured upon his head in Baptisme, or the Baptismal water poured upon ours, by which we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and clensed from the staine of sin. Or else the water of life, and promulgation of the Gospel (the Word of God being often compared to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) which testifie againe, and declare him to be a Prophet. And the blood shed upon the Cross, of which we keep to this day a commemoration in the Sacrament, is a third Witness;<note place="margin">Isa. 53.10.</note> and declares that he was our Priest to offer his soul a Sacrifice for us. These three benefits then, the Graces of his Spirit, our Regeneration by the Gospel, our Redemption by his blood, do to us on earth evidently demonstrate that he was that Messiah, a King to govern, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to enlighten, a Priest to appease God for us.</p>
               <p>The three Witnesses on earth I call not forth at this time. The other three only I shall set before you; and I have chosen to do it this day, that we may do the work of the day upon the day, joyntly bless the holy Trinity for the goodness declared toward the children of men;<note place="margin">Rev. 4.8, 10.</note> that with the <hi>foure and twenty Elders we cast down our Crownes, and fall before him that sits upon the Throne, and cry, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatsoever some peevish and perverse spirits have thought, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of high and holy dayes are not so unnecessary and superstitious as men suppose. The intention of our Mother the Church in their Ordination being first to instruct her children, next to raise their hearts to a joyful thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The observation of the day is an easie help to rub up the memory, or to fasten in it, even of the most illiterate man, the great work that God did for him, as upon that day; that he was conceiv'd by the holy Ghost in a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin womb, born, dyed, rose, ascended to heaven for him, and being set on the right hand of God, gave gifts to men: Gifts, which are effusions of the whole Trinity. So that a man would think, that those who have cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the dayes on which these benefits were remembred, intended that the benefits should be forgotten also, and that men should be to seek for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of their Creed.</p>
               <p>But there was yet another purpose in it, it was that we should rejoyce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and bless his holy Name, who hath done so great things for sinful man. God would not have his people like beasts, which feed and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look upward, but really affected with what he hath done, and for it to exult and be glad, and for it to express our joy to the eare and eye of others.<note place="margin">Psalm 118.24.</note> Dumb and silent remembrances please him not; there is <hi>vox Psalterii,</hi> the found of the Viol, and all Instruments of <hi>David,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thus speak the Prophets; <hi>David</hi> in the Psalmes,<note place="margin">Psal. 83.18. &amp; 86.10. &amp; 18.31 Isa. 45.5. &amp; 42.8. &amp; 44.6, 8.</note>

As therefore it is necessary there be but one infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power, so it is necessary that there be but one only God, from whose Unity all diversity doth proceed; as from one point all sorts of lines, from one number all equality and inequality of numbers.</p>

The Devil was not so mad or foolish, to desire an impossible thing, he would only be Independent, no Subject, but command in his Kingdome, as God did in his, and enjoy his own as his own, freely, and not precariously as a homager.

To erect then more powers than one, is to be of the Devils conspiracy, and to fetch from Hell, that old blasphemy of the <hi>Manichees</hi> who made two principles, one of good, another of evil; one of light, another of darkness; one of heat, another of cold; one of health, another of sickness.</p>
                  <p>But take a view of all the creatures of the world, and tell me whether they do not proclaime their Maker to be but One. In the Elements we finde contrary qualities, heat and cold, moysture and siccity; and where there is contrariety, there will be Warre. Were there then one God of the cold, another of the heat; one power to command over moyst, another over dry bodyes, there would be continual factions, perpetual quarrels betwixt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements. Whereas it is now One God that keeps them quiet, causeth that one usurp not each others rights and places, and sweetly unites them for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of natural bodyes.</p>
                  <p>What should I say, that all things in Nature, Art, and Policy, tend to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? In man the branches of many veines are from one Liver, of many nervs from one braine, many arteryes proceed from one heart. And though the body be composed of parts of different qualities, yet it hath but one head for the guidance and direction of all, and one soul to direct and guide that one head. In a Tree there be divers boughs, sprigs, and armes, yet all con-center in the same body, and both meet in one root. To which <hi>Porphiry</hi> compares his Scale of Universals, in which you ascend from the particulars to the Species, and so upwards till you come to the highest <hi>Genus, Ens,</hi> in which are united whatsoever you can conceive. So that this diversity is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into an unity, till at last you come by degrees to that unity, than which nothing can be more one. For <hi>Unum &amp; Ens convertuntur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis a most true Observation, that Art imitates Nature; and what is it that makes any Art differ from any other but unity? The unity of the object and the end being the essential difference; and yet the learned are not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; they think it would be an occasion of quarrel, should they thus stand single, without any respect one to another, and therefore they have linked
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:200414:51"/> them together by subordination, that one might assist the other in the proof of their principles: Over all which they have set the Metaphysiques as a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervisor to examine, to confirme, to judge what shall be receiv'd for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Truth.

And if reason hath taught us yet over all to appoint one, let the same reason teach us also, that it is as necessary to allow One God to Rule the whole.

By essence a thing is meant having being in it self, but common unto others; As the nature of man is to be a reasonable creature, which yet is not so restrain'd to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, but all equally share in it. And thus the Deity or Nature of the Godhead, which yet is not so limited to the Father, but the Son and the holy Ghost equally partake of it. By person is meant a substance having exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence in himself, intelligent, incommunicable, no part of another, nor sustained by any other. Thus we say <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are distinct, and intelligent persons; for though they all agree in the Nature of man, yet they have every one a particular existence. For <hi>Peter</hi> is not <hi>James,</hi> nor <hi>John</hi> the same numerically with either. To apply this to my purpose. Thus we believe and teach, that God is one in Nature and Essence of himself, subsisting by himself,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.1. 1 Cor. 8.6. Heb. 2.10.</note>
                     <hi>Al-sufficient of himself; of whom, through whom, in whom are all things.</hi> We nevertheless believe and teach, that this same infinite One is without any confusion distinguished into three Persons.

                  <p>If any one then would conceive aright in his minde the Divine Nature, he must conceive of God or the Godhead absolutely; if any of the Persons, then he must conceive of the same Godhead, with the relation it hath to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal properties. Thus the Godhead consider'd with the property of Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or begetting, is the person of the <hi>Father.</hi> The same Godhead consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the property of being begotten, is the person of the <hi>Son.</hi> And the same Godhead again consider'd with the property of proceeding, is the person of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. But I proceed. <hi>Actiones sunt suppositorum.</hi> Individuals only exist, and are alone active, especially about such works as the Scripture attributes to these three. To create is the work of a person. To take a body, to redeem, to reconcile, to govern, the work of a person. To sanctifie, to be Lord, to speak, to teach, to reprove, to comfort, to be a witnesse, to place Bishops, to make Decrees in Councils, are all personal acts; actions all of a person ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent, working, living, endued with understanding and will. But all these are the actions of the blessed Trinity, and therefore it is necessary that there be three Persons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of the person of the Father, there is no doubt: it is the Personality of the Sonne and the Holy Ghost that is oppos'd. But no man who believes the Scriptures, can call that in question.

               <p>The Spirit of God is then call'd the Spirit of bondage unto fear; not as if it made men bondmen in whom it works, but because it first makes them see the bond in which they were bound, the penalty if not perform'd; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conscience of the breach there follows a deadly fear; so it was in those Converts, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. <hi>What shall we do?</hi> and in those in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Ver. 10, 12, 14. Acts 2.37.</note>
                  <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, what shall we do to be saved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the first operation of the Spirit; and this the <hi>Romans</hi> had receiv'd in their first conversion. A great fear for that they had not kept their bond. And in all the Elect that are of discretion, the Spirit of God works by this feare, before it begets a filial assurance that all may know they stand in need of Christ and seek him.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.24.</note>
                  <hi>The Law is our Schoole-master to bring us to Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But this assent is again accompanied with love and comfort. A love of the Commands, and a comfort in the promises of the Gospel, when we remember that he that imposed the one and made the other, is our Father; whence with confidence we profess, <hi>Credo in Deum Patrem, I believe in God the Father,</hi> or as the Apostle here, <hi>We cry Abba Pater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abba</hi> is Originally Hebrew; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Graec. Father;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 118.22. Acts 4.11.</note> and the Apostle useth both tongues to animate both Nations, Jews and Greeks, by this honour of Filiation. For being both united in that one stone which is the Head of the Corner, there is no more distinction. Every one of both Nations who partakes of this Spirit of Adoption, may boldly approach the Throne of grace, and say <hi>Our Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostle in the Verse before had said, <hi>that we are the Sonnes of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 19.2.</note> and in this and the next he proves it by that fear and love that are in all those that receive the Spirit. That receive it I say; for it is a receipt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ephesus</hi> ask'd, <hi>Whether they had received the Spirit:</hi> And it is cleare, that without this Receipt we have no Seale to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</p>
               <p>Now with the Spirit we receive two things, which are the two several ways of working in the Sons of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is feare, which the Apostle here calls the spirit of bondage, which requires strict service, as I said, and exact obedience, calling to us <hi>Fac,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:200414:56"/> fac vel timore poenae,</hi> Do it man, do as you are bidden, though it be meerly for feare of punishment; And this is an excellent and necessary introduction fit for beginners in the faith. It is like the base Court, which a man must pass before he enters into the Palace. And it seemes the <hi>Romanes</hi> had past through it; This againe in the Text intimates so much; They were not againe to receive this Spirit of feare, therefore they had once before receiv'd it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second is by love, which the Apostle calls <hi>the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> This speaks to them as to Sons, commands them to obey as before, but not out of a servile, but a filial feare. As if he had said, That very Spirit which taught you at first as servants for terrour to keep and do the duties of the Law, now as Sonnes leads you to performe the same obedience, and to walk in newness of life. The duties then are the same, the Spirit that ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles you the same; but the reason whence they arise is not the same; for at first they sprang from fear, but now from love.</p>
               <p>The Apostle then in this place makes not here his comparison betwixt the godly, who had submitted themselves to that easie Yoke of the Gospel, with them who yet lived under the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> But the collation is betwixt those who had given up their names to Christ within themselves, and in them he compares a second operation of the Spirit with the first: Within them it was not as it was before. Before no more comfort they could have, than their service could assure them in doing their duties, and then feare must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their best endeavours, as being conscious to themselves that the best work that they could do, was either polluted or imperfect. But upon their second receipt great comfort they might take, in that God was their Father, and they his Sonnes. And therefore <hi>as a father pitieth his own children, so God would be merciful to those that feare him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 103.13.</note> This wrought upon them to do their service out of love. And that which wrought this love in their hearts, was the Spirit of Adoption which they had received.</p>
               <p>Yea, but how shall it appear that they had received him? How? By feeling and experience. Of which</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is the <hi>Clamamus</hi> here. That he hath poured upon us the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace and supplication, by which with zeale and fervour of spirit, with contention of voice, and intention of heart, without intermission we call and cry to him <hi>Abba Pater,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 12.10. 1 Cor. 12.3.</note>
                  <hi>exandi nos, O good Father heare us. No man with confidence and boldness can call God Father, but by the Holy Ghost.</hi> This you now can do. Therefore you have received the Spirit of Adoption.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the next verse. <hi>For the same Spirit beares witnesse with our Spirit, that we are the Sonnes of God.</hi> Note here, that not our Spirit, nor the Spirit of God alone gives in this Testimony, but both concurring and meeting together. Our spirit cannot alone make this Certificate, because mans heart is alwayes evil, and too too often deceitful.<note place="margin">Gen. 6.5. Jer. 17.9.</note> And Gods Spirit makes not this perswasion comfortably in any, without the witness of our spirit. <hi>For if our conscience condemn us, God is greater than our hearts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.20, 21.</note>
                  <hi>and knows all things: But if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then we may be assured that we have received the Spirit of Adoption. Then we may boldly say, <hi>I believe in God the Father Almighty.</hi> Then we may with comfort approach the Throne of grace,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.16.</note> and pray, <hi>Our Father.</hi> Then we may lay our claime, and cry in all our distresses, <hi>Abba Pater.</hi> For if we be Sons, then are we Heirs, even Heirs of this God our Father, and co-heirs annexed with Christ, as the Apostle hath for our comfort concluded at the 17. Verse.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:200414:56"/>1. Now two sorts of men there are that make use of this Certificate; the one too much, and the other too little. There be that live after the flesh, yet boast of the Spirit; such are carnal professors, whom <hi>Solomon</hi> hath thus described to us; <hi>There is a generation that curseth their father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 30.11, 12 13.</note>
                  <hi>and doth not bless their mother; There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not wash'd from their filthinesse; There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes, and their eye lids are lifted up; There is a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whose teeth are swords, and their jaw-teeth as Knives to devoure the poore from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</hi> And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their curses, their filthiness, their pride, their cruelty, they will be, I had almost said alone, their fathers best children; for which if you ask an evidence, presumptuously they will produce this place, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The Spirit beareth witnesse with our spirit.</hi> The Spirit; what Spirit? the spirit of errour, the spirit of seduction, the lying spirit, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of pride; for God hath no Sonnes, but those who are like him. The Spirit of Adoption is the Spirit of Sanctification; first he makes a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then beares witness. Pretend not then the Testimony of the Holy Ghost for thy Adoption, without the Certificate of thine own conscience; nor that of thine own conscience, without that of the Holy Ghost, for these must go together. As is thy faith and repentance, such is thy Certificate; so certaine, so comfortable, and no more. Take heed then, and split not upon the Rock of presumption, for it is Pharisaism.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But as there be, who look upon this Certificate too boldly, so also there are, who behold it, and reade it with too weak an eye, who for the most part are yet the best children. For none so apt to complaine of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the absence of their Father, and his Spirit, as they who are most spiritual. Gods Children are like covetous rich men, who think that they have nothing, because they thirst for more. But as the Carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour may not presume, so let not the weak Christian despaire, because he alwayes feels not the witness of the Spirit in the same measure. In spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual desertions, good it will be to have recourse to the former Comforts; Let such remember their joyful Songs, their devout prayers, their sharp combates, their thirst, their hunger after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ighteousnesse, their constant desires, their sincere studyes and endeavours, and by these collect their estate: And this will keep them from the Rock of despaire. All these are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of the Spirit of <hi>Adoption,</hi> and therefore they may yet with comfort cry <hi>Abba Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus have I given you an accompt for the sense and connexion of these words with the former, and the subsequent. And out of these I could raise many profitable Notes. As that</p>
               <p>First, Prayer is a Gift of the Spirit of Adoption, in that it is here said, <hi>In quo.</hi> In whom, that is, in the Power of this Spirit we cry.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this our prayer ought to be zealous, importunate, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, a clamour, a cry. <hi>Clamamus,</hi> saith the Apostle; so our Saviour,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.7. Exod. 17.4. Cap. 14.15. Psal. 130.1. Jonah 2.2.</note> so <hi>Moses,</hi> so <hi>David,</hi> so <hi>Jonah</hi> pray'd. Our Saviour with strong cryes in the Garden, <hi>Moses</hi> at the red Sea, <hi>David</hi> out of the deep, <hi>Jonah</hi> from the belly of the Whale.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That our prayer must be daily, constant, without ceasing; for <hi>Clamamus</hi> is the Present tense, which notes the present time; an action not to be delay'd or put off, but presently to be done.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That all good men joyn their forces, and combine in prayer. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle that spoke in the second person before, <hi>Recepistis Spiritum,</hi> yet when they came to cry, then he would make One. In whom we cry altogether, <hi>Our Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:200414:57"/>5. In that there is Charity. But in that we reflect upon him in our petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as a Father, and pathetically cry, <hi>Abba, Pater,</hi> this is a seale of our faith, and gives us boldnesse, and confidence to approach him. Many impediments there may be, which may deter us from coming into his presence, and which may retard our supplications. But this one word, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> may animate us,<note place="margin">Luke 15.18.</note> and quicken them. Say thou be a Prodigal, remember that he is thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; come then to thy self, arise and go to thy Father. Thy conscience tells thee,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.14.</note> that God is a God of pure eyes, and that thou art carnal, and sold under sinne, and will he then look upon such a one? But again remember, that he is a Father,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.13.</note> and he cannot deny himself. Cry with the affection of a sonne, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, Father,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>You see what a plentiful harvest I have of a little seed; but I cannot now stand to gather and thresh out every sheaf, and shall only then make choyce of of the last, <hi>Abba, Father;</hi> Because it will serve me to make bread of that Notion of the <hi>Creed</hi> upon which I am fallen, <hi>I beleeve in God the Father.</hi>
               </p>

                  <p>The meaning of the point is, that the power of the glorious and great God is effectual to the production of all things.</p>
                  <p>It is usual to call him the Father of the family, <hi>from whom all that family is derived,</hi> and by whose counsel and power it is guided and protected. And in this sense we call God the Father of the Universe,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.6.</note> in that he makes, governs, and by his providence orders the whole. Hence is that question proposed by <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 2.10.</note>
                     <hi>Is not he thy Father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?</hi> But shorter in <hi>Malachi, Have we not all one Father? Hath not one God created us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a favour imparted at large, even to the least flye, much more to the worst man;<note place="margin">Matth. 5.45.</note> for he feeds, preserves, maintains, adorns, even Publicans and sinners; to him, those that every day blaspheme him, are more beholding for the expression of these paternal acts, than to their parents that begat them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides then this common favour, there must be one more peculiar, by which all the acts of a Father are performed unto sons, but in a farre higher and more
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:200414:57"/> excellent degree than unto other creatures, or unto other men. And such there be.</p>
                  <p>For to some he gives that power and honour to be, and to be called the sons of God: He is well pleased that some lay their claime, and call him <hi>Abba,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1.12.</note>
                     <hi>Father:</hi> He hath ordained some to be Heirs, even Co-heirs annexed with Christ. These he begets by his Word and Spirit, which are the Principles of their New and Celestial life. These he assists with his Grace,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.15. John 1.13.</note> which is able to continue and preserve what he hath begotten. No father can be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his sons education, than he is of their breeding; and to that purpose he guids their feet, where the way is dangerous, and opens their eyes, where the path is dark; and prevents a temptation, when it is too powerful; and quickens them up, when they are heavie and dull, and have no mind to learn.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.3, 4.</note> But this is not all neither, when they are past their minority, which lasts as long as his life lasts; he hath provided an inheritance for them, not by the death of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by the Purchase of the Son, of which he hath given these his children an assurance of his Spirit, and will put them into possession in another world.</p>
                  <p>Me thinks it cannot satisfie to huddle up so many acts of Grace, and such inestimable indulgences, and to present them thus in grosse. It will not then I hope seeme tedious unto you, that I sort these particulars, and offer them to your view one by one, it must needs chear up the heart of every gracious child, to hear that he hath so good and munificent a Father.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I passe by here how out of a lump of red earth,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.27. &amp; 2.7.</note> and Virgin-clay he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med man to no other likenesse, than that of himself. Out of which pattern for succeeding posterity, when our enemy by temptation had prevail'd to blot Gods image, our gracious Father began to think how it might be restored as at first. And no other way being found to effect it, he that was the expresse image of his person, offered himself to become like man, that so man again might become like God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And when He again left the world, and departed to his Father, He sent down his Spirit to dwell with us, to abide with us, to renew us, to reform us,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.16, 17. Tit. 3.5. Heb. 9.10. 1 Thes. 5.23.</note> to work all manner of sanctity in our hearts. The secret preventions, the inward and quick excitations, those sobs and throbs of heart, those powerful assistances, those calls and motions to good, are to no other end, but that you <hi>put off the old man, with his deeds, and that you put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Colos. 3.9, 10.</note> The Holy Ghost then does but the same work for which the Son of God was born, <hi>viz.</hi> That we might be reborn, and have the holy image of our Father once more stamped upon us, and look like our Fathers children.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And we, who are his Embassadours, make all our addresses to you for the same purpose.

                     <hi>1.</hi> The Spirit of Adoption.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adoption</hi> is an act of Grace, found out for the comfort of those who have no children, or if they have, yet out of some deep dislike have cast them off. By this the person so chosen, is put in the place, and honoured with the title of a sonne, and intended to be the heire. This is the indulgence of men; but we finde the God of heaven far more indulgent in this act. For this spiritual Adoption far exceeds that which is civil, and with us usual.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The civil was found out by man. This proceeded from God.<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.5.</note> God the Father destinated us unto the adoption of children, &amp;c. 2. The civil was brought in for the comfort of a father that wants children and heires; this for the comfort of a child, that wants a father. 3. In the civil no man adopts, that hath a son and heire, or that hath not for some enormity judged him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his inheritance: but in this, the father had a son and heire, and there was no dislike, nor no reason for it, and yet he adopts strangers to be coheires with his son. 4. The civil often hath its rise from some outward motive, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nearnesse of blood, or consideration of some rare parts in the person adopted, or blind affection: But this had no such cause, it was not from faith or works foreseene, nor for any mans righteousnesse, nor uprightnesse of heart,<note place="margin">Deut. 9.5.</note> nor for any proximity; for we were aliens and strangers to him; It proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meerly <hi>ex motu proprio;</hi> he adopted us according to the good pleasure of his will. 5. Lastly, in the civil,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.5.</note> the manners and conditions of the adopted is not chang'd; make choice of an Ethiop, and adopt him for your son, and he remains as black as before; whereas in this adoption the man becomes a new man, his life is bettered, his ways of another fashion; he is so sanctified, so cleansed, that should you compare him with what he was, and what he is, you would scarce take him to be the same man. And that you wonder no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at it, at the instant of the Adoption, they</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>2.</hi> Receive the Spirit.</head>
                  <p>Do not think it in vain, that the Apostle phraseth it thus. He might have said Adoption barely, but that he doth not, but puts us in mind of the Spirit that comes to our Adoption, and that for weighty reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because this Spirit transforms the man,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> and makes him walk not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the flesh, but by the conduct of the Spirit. No sooner shall you finde a man admitted into this catalogue of sons, but you shall find him a new man.<note place="margin">Acts 9. Luke 7. Luke 10.39.</note>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> is made a <hi>Paul; Mary</hi> the City sinner, or as <hi>Ambrose</hi> hath it, the Cities sinne, is turned into <hi>Mary</hi> the devout. Are thy wayes foul, vitious, sottish, profane, whorish? The foul spirit is yet in thee. Art thou humble, penitent, meek, circumspect? thy own spirit brought thee not to that; it was this Spirit of Adoption.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or secondly, because till he comes, there is none of our Fathers work done in any child of God; <hi>The natural man perceives not the things of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9. to 16</note> the understanding is dark, the will perverse, the affections bent to evil. He, and He alone makes us partakers of the divine nature; Illuminates, renewes,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> teacheth, incites, confirms, prayes in us, and makes us do all the duties of sons;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.27. Ephes. 4.30.</note> in one word, seals us to the day of redemption.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And that Sealing is to us the Spirit of Adoption. For Adoption hath to us no Spirit, life or heart in it, till it come to that. The name of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the inheritance made over unto us, are but like an Indenture fairly drawn, from which we have no assurance that we shall receive any benefit, till the seale be set. That being once done, then we may be confident that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:200414:59"/> what is contain'd in the Deed, is made over to us. Very precious promises our gracious Father hath made to all his Adopted children; and that they nothing doubt of the enjoyment of them, he hath given them his Spirit to be a <hi>Witnesse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.16. Eph. 4.30. Eph. 1.14.</note> a <hi>Seale,</hi> a <hi>Pledge,</hi> an <hi>Earnest</hi> to secure the Inheritance. And all who are his Sonnes have receiv'd this Spirit; not Adoption only, but the comfort of Adoption, which at one time or other is brought home, and laid up in their bosome.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>David</hi> was offer'd <hi>Sauls</hi> daughter to Wife, he thought himself too mean for that Honour; in humility he disparages his birth, and blood; he labours to put it off with,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18.18.</note>
                     <hi>Who am I, that I should be a Sonne in law to a King?</hi> And I pray what are all we? from what Race are we sprung? <hi>are we not potsheards of the earth?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 45.9.</note> how comes then this about that we should not only be sons in law, but adopted sons? not to an earthly father, but to the King of all the earth? It had been a great favour to have been reckoned in the number of his menial servants; <hi>David</hi> boasted of that Title,<note place="margin">Psalm 116.16. James 2.23. 1 Kings 20.33. John 1.3, 7.</note>
                     <hi>I am thy servant;</hi> a greater to have been the <hi>friend of God,</hi> as was <hi>Abraham;</hi> To be a Brother so great an honour, that one King greedily catcht at it from another, <hi>Thy Brother Benhadad. Qualem ergo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi> I ask you what kinde of love this was? teach me I pray, for I know not of what quality it is, or how to expresse it; I ask againe, what kinde of love is this,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.6.8.10. Ephes. 2.12. Gen. 18.27. John 15.15.

                  <p>Had this been the first houre that these Titles had been sounded in your eares, I feare that would have befallen me, which happened to <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>

                     <hi>for some vaine babler;</hi> It so far passeth Humane reason, that a sinful man should be thus dignified.

But this is now become the common Report of every Evangelist, of every Apostle; there is not a Book extant, in which we finde not the Original Indenture betwixt God and man running in these termes of Relation: The Inheritance being passed in a Fathers Name to his adopted Sonnes: Which because it is stale News, we slight, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue, and little regard.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Lastly, If God be your Father, then you must learn to suffer patiently under his hand, if it please him at any time to afflict and cross you. For he hath not a Sonne whom one way or other, at some time or other, he doth not chastise; so it must be; for should it fall out otherwise,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.6, 7, 8.</note> we were Bastards and not Sonnes.<note place="margin">

Bernard</hi> confesseth that he could never reade this Text without extream horrour. <hi>Contremisco solo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditu,</hi> I shiver, saith he, to heare that God will not be angry, that he will not punish, that he will not visit; I will none of this mercy; <hi>supra omnem iram est haec miseratio,</hi> this pity is beyond all anger: For how can I ever be assured that I am his Childe, if I never receive any correction from him? What father can you name, that gave not, or caused correction to be given to his childe? I never read of any but one who scaped the Rod, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Traytour. <hi>Adoniah</hi> was the childe that <hi>David</hi> never displeased at any time, or said so much to him as <hi>Why hast thou done so?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 1.5.</note> and he would needs be in his fathers Throne, before his fathers head was laid up in his grave. A dangerous indulgence then it is in a father not to frown, and miserable mercy in God not to punish. Sometimes to shew his anger, is a greater evidence of his love; which when this our kinde Father doth toward his untoward chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if they beare it patiently, no surer Argument of their adoption. <hi>For whom he loveth, he chasteneth, and scourgeth every Son that he receiveth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.21. Heb. 12.6.</note> Frown and fight he may, but cast off and hate he will not. And therefore it becomes us to be patient. In regard then of your adoption, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, do the duties of Sonnes. Take all things in good part that come from his hands; tread in his steps, and readily and heartily obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands (which three are the true properties of good children) and upon the performance of these, there will arise to you divers consolations and solid comforts. For as a fathers name is a <hi>memento</hi> for duty, so is it also a stay and ground-work of hope.</p>
                  <p>First, Upon the endeavour to walk in your fathers steps, his love will beare with, and pass by many wants and imperfections in a childe. <hi>For as a father spares his own Son, so will God spare them that feare him;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psalm 103.13.</note> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine

                     <note place="margin">Mal. 3.16.17.</note>
                     <hi>That a Book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his Name. And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that day when I make up my Jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own Son that serveth him.</hi> It is not for nothing that we reade of a distinction of spots; the spots of the Leopard,<note place="margin">Jer. 13.23. Deut. 32.5.</note> and the spots of Sonnes; those are the spots of a beast, these of a childe. 'Tis not the Herb Borith, nor Fullers sope can purge the first, for their spot is not the spot of children; but our brothers blood will purge the last,<note place="margin">Numb. 23.21.</note> so that <hi>God will not see iniquity in Jacob,</hi> not see it to impute it, not see it to punish it; no more than a father will the distorted Characters and blots in his childs Copy, when he is fully perswaded of his utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Farther yet, a strong hope we have from this name that we shall not lose our reward. It cannot be denyed, that for our untowardness we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to lose our Inheritance; but the comfort is, that if we returne, our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not disinherit us. For the childe he loves once, he loves for ever. Though <hi>Absolom</hi> were an ungracious childe,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.3. 2 Sam. 18.5.</note> yet in the very height of his Treason, <hi>David</hi> his father loved him still, he commanded the Captaines to use him kindly for his sake; and upon the Relation of his unlucky death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took him to his Chamber,<note place="margin">33.</note> and wept, and cry'd, <hi>O Absolom my sonne!</hi> So it is with our gracious Father even at the instant of our Rebellions, though our Treasons make him pursue us, yet he loves when he strikes, and sighs when he punisheth any of his. <hi>Ah, I will be avenged.</hi> And his work then is <hi>to purge away thr drosse,</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, This name brings them home when they are gone astray, this name animates their petitions, this name conveys their soules to Heaven. God is a Name of Majesty, Lord of power, both may deter us in our approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to him; but Father is a Name of mercy, that calls us into the Mount.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:200414:60"/> The Kings children may come into his presence, when others in contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Majesty and greatness, must stand without.</p>
                  <p>When you petition, <hi>Our Father</hi> is to be the first word;<note place="margin">Mat. 6.9. Luke 15.21. Luke 23.34. Mat. 6 12. Luke 23.46.</note> when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess your sinnes, <hi>Pater, peccavi,</hi> is a good forme to begin with; in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions, <hi>Pater ignosce, Father forgive,</hi> hath authority from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours lips. When you part with the world, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit,</hi> is an excellent ejaculation to end with: So that Praying, Confessing, Repenting, Interceding, Dying, we finde comfort in this Name.</p>
                  <p>I shall repeat it over againe while we are here; if we cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> he is ready to receive our prayers while we are here; if we acknowledge, <hi>Father I have sinn'd against heaven, and against thee,</hi> he is ready to receive our confession: While we are here, if at any time we repent, and say with the Prodigal, <hi>I will arise, and go to my father,</hi> he is ready to receive us to grace; and when we go hence, can we but say with our Saviour,<note place="margin">John 16.10.

Grace is from God the Father, and mercy is from God the Father, and peace is from God the Father, and glory is from God the Father. <hi>There is no gift, or perfect gift, but comes down from this Father of lights.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I see I must break from this point, or else I shall never get from it. For I confess I have found an honey-comb, and I could be content to suck it for ever. But I have one Use more to make of this Name, and so I will end. To shut up all then, is God a Father? then without question he will provide for his children; <hi>for the children lay not up for the fathers,</hi>

                  <p>Our Saviour would not have his followers over careful <hi>what they should eat, or what they should drink, or wherewith they should be cloathed;</hi>

                  <p>To care for the world I need not exhort you, for that you are so solicitous already, as if you did distrust your Fathers providence. It shall be then my Petition at this time to you, that you would depose some of these worldly thoughts,<note place="margin">Col. 3.1.</note> and instead thereof entertaine Heavenly; that you would <hi>set your affections on things above,</hi> where Christ your Elder Brother sits on the right hand of God. There your Heavenly Father hath provided for you also, yea, and far better things than these transitory vanities, a Crown, a Kingdome, a Throne,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.3, 4.</note>
                     <hi>an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you;</hi> For if we be Sonnes, then are we Heires, and co-heires to such an Inheritance which earth cannot afford. Ours here, the greatest are subject to three foule inconveniences, Corruption, Soyle, and Fading. They corrupt in the substance; are defiled and full of soyle in the quality; and fade in the beauty. Whatsoever we can inherit here below, is subject to one, nay to all these. It corrupts, takes soyle, fades. But that Inheritance which our Father hath prepared for us, is in danger of none of these. It is uncorrupt, and will hold its being, none ever shall disherit or disseize us of it. Undefiled, and shall hold the test, none ever shall embase it with any mixture.<note place="margin">Jonah 4.7.</note> Fade or decay it will not; <hi>Jonahs</hi> worme shall not bite it, but it shall hold out its prime perfection and beauty.</p>
                  <p>Now blessed be God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his abundant mercy,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.3, 4.</note> hath begotten us (which is the act of a father) to a lively hope of this Inheritance: And blessed be our Elder Brother Jesus Christ, who hath purchased this Inheritance for us: And blessed be the Spirit of God, who hath set to the Seale, and given us security, that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance is reserved for us in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Kept for us it is, and kept in Heaven, which is well for us; for had it been kept on earth, it might have gone the same way that Paradise did. Now since that is kept for us, let us also keep our selves for it, keep from all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, keep from all wilfull contempts of our Father, as little as we can transgress any of his Commands; and when that falls out, fall down at his feet, and cry, <hi>Pater peccavi, Father I have sinned.</hi> For upon our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,<note place="margin">Luke 15.18, 20</note> confession, and amendment, still the Inheritance shall be ours. While we are yet a great way off, our Father will see us on the way, he will have compassion on us, runne and make haste to meet us, fall on our neck and embrace us, and give us a kiss, a sure Token of our Reconciliation. <hi>He will call together his friends and neighbours, Saints and Angels, and say unto them,</hi>

               <p>THis Psalm is a brief Record of Gods goodness to <hi>Israel,</hi> and of <hi>Israels</hi> untowardness to God: that with them he established a Testimony, and appointed them a Law; the first Act of grace: that for their sake he did wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he divided the Sea, that he led them with a Cloud,<note place="margin">Ver. 5.12, 13, 24.</note> fed them with Manna. Reade the Psalm, you may see what he did; every verse almost being a memorial of his favour. Notwithstanding all which, <hi>they were a stubborne and rebellious generation, that set not their heart aright,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note>
                  <hi>and whose heart cleaved not stedfastly to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Report was not made that it should be barely read, and so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over as some other story, for it was written for our instruction. The Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Psalm is <hi>Maschil Asaph,</hi> a Psalm to give instruction, and the Lesson is set upon the file at the 8. verse, <hi>Ne fiant sicut patres eorum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 17, 18, 19.</note> that we should not be as this people, and their fore-fathers were, a cross, and a crooked generation, ready to provoke the most High; forward to tempt God in our heart, to ask meat for our lusts, to speak against him.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Ne fiat,</hi> this obstinacy and infidelity, there be no such Retentives as the consideration of the goodness of God, and his power; of both which the first Article of our Creed puts us in minde; of his goodness, in that he is a Father; of his power, in that he is Omnipotent; the first intimates that he will, for who so ready to do a good turne to his childe as a father? the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that if he will he can; for being Almighty he wants no power. And therefore if we ask and have not, let us never question with the <hi>Isra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Of his good-will I have spoken sufficiently in the last. The Name of a Father is a Seale for that.

If there be an obliquity in them, as was in this, we must be charged with that; but the power by which we do ought, proceeds from him; The fault and error is ours, the action as natural is his. And there is reason for it; For if an instrumental cause have no power in it self to produce an effect, but by the vertue of the Principal, especially when the instrumental depends upon the principal both for its essence and ability to work: Let God then have the honour both of the action and effect, so that what is amisse in it, and erroneous, be charged upon his servant <hi>Moses.</hi> For, if we survey the story, finde we shall, that it was he that smote, and not God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He smote;</hi> And in that he passeth his Commission. He was commanded to speak only to the Rock,<note place="margin">Num. 20.8, 11.</note> and he gave it two blows; he was charged only to call for water, and he would as good as force and presse it out of the stone.</p>

This is, <hi>acsi faetor stomachi aperto ore profundatur,</hi> as if a man should vomit what offends the stomach at his mouth,<note place="margin">Musculus in loc</note> and bring up and out the sin that is conceived within.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The dishonour by this his rash and unadvised over-cholerique expression done to God; for thereby his Name was blasphemed, as if <hi>Moses</hi> rod and blow had done the miracle, and not Gods immediate hand; with this also God char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them, <hi>Ye did not sanctifie me in the eyes of the children of Israel.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 20.12.</note> These were the errors of <hi>Moses</hi> and his brother <hi>Aaron;</hi> and the punishment fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the same verse; <hi>Therefore you shall not bring this Congregation into the Land which I have given them.</hi> And hence we may collect the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the offence, that God for it did not spare his choycest servant. That we are to make of it, is this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To beware we transgresse not our Commission, and do that for which we have no Warrant. Even actions in their own nature good, change and alter, become stark naught, and offend God in a high degree that cannot be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The self-same action, that is commendable in one, is sinful in another, being done without a Vocation. To offer sacrifice is in it self good, but it was punished in <hi>Saul,</hi> and in <hi>Ʋzziah,</hi> because they would invade the Priests office,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13.8, 9. 2 Chron. 26.19</note> and for a Scepter take a Censer. The Sword is allowable in the Superiours hands, not so in <hi>Peters,</hi> for he is commanded to put it up, having no warrant from his Master to draw it. And so must all that are in <hi>Peters</hi> case,<note place="margin">John 18.11.</note> keep the sword in its place, and never drawn but upon command; for in that place it is cursed, when otherwise taken forth. <hi>Ex officio,</hi> upon a warrantable call men, are bound to do what they do; and then again not <hi>exilire limites,</hi> not to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse their authority.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For secondly, we must take heed that anger and choler transport us not, no not in Gods cause.

Thus God deals with his servants, presently he takes them not away upon their sinne, but delays them, and gives them a time of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; yea sometimes debars them of their milk and hony, that they may see and confesse what they have deserved to lose; yet upon their return, for an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Cannan</hi> which they have deserved to lose, they shall enter into a celestial, of which that was but a type.</p>

A miracle I say, God to content his people did, and then too, when they had little care to content him.</p>

                  <p>What Boanerges would not here call for fire from heaven to consume them, or an opening of the earth again to swallow them! But behold the tender mercy and long-suffering of God: In stead of fire to consume, see here wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to coole their unquiet appetite: In stead of opening to swallow, the earth opens, and that in the hardest part a rock to fill their mouths.

                  <p>And now give me leave to ask you, <hi>Amici, ad quid venistis?</hi> my friends, wherefore are you come? only to heare of <hi>Israel</hi> thus plentifully satisfied with water? only to reade a miracle how great streams gushed out of a Rock? This were to see other men cooled, and your selves to remain in a flame still. And therefore drink you also and be satisfied; <hi>for this Rock was Christ;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.4.</note> not in substance, but in signification; and the water that came from thence, a type or shadow of our Saviours blood.</p>
                  <p>This Rock was smitten, and so was he. <hi>Moses</hi> smote the Rock, and it was the Law that gave him the blow. In <hi>Moses</hi> Rod was the hand of God, and in his sufferings Gods hand was also;<note place="margin">Lam. 1, 12. John 19.34. Psalm 130.7.</note> for thus it was done to him in the fierceness of his wrath. Out of the Rock there gushed water, and streams o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowed; and out of his side there issued a flow of water, and a streame of blood, that we might have <hi>Copiosam Redemptionem,</hi> not only Redemption, but Redemption in abundance from all the enemies we stood in feare of; from sinne, from the grave, from hell, from the devil: Water enough to refresh our thirsty souls, and blood enough to bath and wash away our pollutions: Water enough to quench the fire of Hell, and blood enough to deliver us from the power of darkness.</p>
                  <p>With one mouth Interpreters after the Apostle teach us, that this Rock was the Type of Christ, a Rock that upholds the whole Fabrick of his Church; and he was smitten by the Jews, of whom <hi>Moses</hi> may be a figure; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the blow he received at his death there sprung a fountaine of grace, with which his Church hath been refreshed ever since. What word is that which hath slipt my mouth <hi>Ever since?</hi> I must recall it;<note place="margin">Zach. 13.1.</note> for I said too little of this Fountaine; they that lived before it was opened, as well as we who have lived since the Water and Blood gushed out, have been the better for it.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant made with them and us the same, the person in whom it was made the same; the Sacraments by which it was Sealed in substance the same, the conditions on which it was to be made good the same, <hi>viz. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith,</hi> which had the same object, <hi>the seed of the woman;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.22.18.</note> to them foretold, to us performed; so that their faith and ours in this may be said to differ, That they believed in Christ to come; we, That he is come. But to return back againe to the Rock, this very place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> were there no other, doth signally shew the concord of the Old and New Sacraments, and consequently, the truth of all I said.</p>
                  <p>For the Sacraments of the Old Testament, circumcision and the Paschal Lamb did signifie Christ, as well as ours; Theirs obscurely, ours more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Of ours there is no question; of theirs the Apostle in this place affirms, <hi>that they all eat the same spiritual meat, and they all drank of the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual drink, which was Christ;</hi> so that in both Sacraments, Old and New, Christ must be <hi>res significata,</hi> the thing signified. Neither can there be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any other reason, why the Holy Ghost doth so fit the Old to the New, and the New to the Old, except on purpose he intended to shew the mutual
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:200414:65"/> concordance betwixt the Old and the New in the thing signified, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and Harmony in the use of both. For as he saith here, <hi>the fathers were baptized;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2.11, 12. 1 Cor. 5.7.</note> so elsewhere he saith, <hi>that we were circumcised; and as they did eat the same spiritual meat, and drink the same spiritual drink, so Christ our Passeover was sacrificed for us.</hi> Why so? except his purpose had been to informe us that the old Patriarchs had the same communion with Christ, which we believe; and that there was one faith, and one Church, both built upon the same Rock, and both refreshed, clensed, sanctified, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the same water.</p>
                  <p>To come to this Fountain he calls us by his Prophet <hi>Isaiah, Ho every one,</hi>

Enough there was for them, and enough there is for us; it flows; and if we draw it by a lively faith, a Well it will be in us springing up to eternal life. <hi>Lord, evermore give us of this water, that we faint not in our greatest thirst.</hi>

I will never be perswaded, that he will ever be a true servant to man on earth, that is not a devout and Religious servant to God in heaven.

                  <p>And to my understanding, two motives are couched in these two words, to quicken us in his service.

And in his delivery, the liberty of his posterity was purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed also, and the freedom of the other Israelites in the setting at large of their fathers.

For it is your and my Jesus in the bosome of his Father, in the womb of his Mother, in his Cratch, on the Cross, in his grave so low, and in his Throne of Glory so high; In a word, it is our common Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; Him I here present you, because I know, notwithstanding your vertues, you need him. And with the same hand I reach him to you, I take him back againe, because I need him more than you; being one to whom God hath lent more yeares, and therefore consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to more sinnes; One placed in a publick Office, and therefore to answer for other mens deficiencies as well as my own.

His Name is an Oyntment poured forth; and it may very well sweeten us both, because it is sufficient to perfume the whole world. Other sweets must be set aside in comparison of this, because they are indeed dung to this.</p>
                     <p>The ill hap is, that this sweet Name hath of late past through some slovenly hands, who have exposed it so rudely, that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed too many to nauseate.

               <p>Without all question it is of his Composure. Who as in his <hi>Proverbs</hi> he reads us many Lectures in the Ethicks, Politicks, and Oeconomicks, and in <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> in the Physicks; so in this Book he is Metaphysical, and Treats upon a Subject beyond both, to wit, of the indissoluble conjunction of Christ and his Church, whose longing desires he presents to us in these words, <hi>Let him kisse me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A passionate expression! and at first it is hard to say of whom, or to whom; The Pronounes, <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Me,</hi> are so indefinite. But be they spoken by whom they will, certainly it is of one deeply in love; for she desires a kiss, and kiss after kiss; kisses doubled, if not trebled; <hi>Let him kisse me with the kisses of his own mouth.</hi> And this is indeed the Solaecisme of love, which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:200414:77"/> thinks that every one is bound to take notice of whom she is enamoured. She sayes only here, <hi>Let him kiss me;</hi> and supposes all the world bound to take notice who this <hi>He</hi> is, whom she meanes, though she discover not his name, nor say one word more. <hi>Amor, quem ipse cogitat, neminem putat ign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And yet <hi>abi Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi>

               <p>The enamour'd soule was here the Church; the object of her love Christ, which takes upon him the person of a loving Husband, to enrich his Spouse with what is his. This she well knowing, longs, and sighs, and wishes for the Marriage day, which was (to speak truth) the day of his Nativity, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition in the flesh. And against that day, <hi>Solomon</hi> moved by the Spirit of God, composed this <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> or wedding Song.</p>
               <p>Which is stiled <hi>Canticum Canticorum;</hi> as if he should say the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of all his Songs.<note place="margin">1 Kings 4.26. Exod. 15.

But this was a Song penn'd to be sung by the whole Church to God, for the Redemption of the World by his Sonne. For look whatsoever God had promised, the Prophets foretold, the Patriarchs expected, the Evangelists wrote, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles preached, either for the building up of our faith, or confirming our hope, is fully, though darkly comprehended in it, <hi>Eloquio jucundo, figurato tamen.</hi>

True, for it had for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the <hi>Messiah.</hi> True againe, in that it did assent and rest in the promise.

Where the love is cold, the prayer is cold; whereas from a heart warm'd with this passion, the petition is earnest.

                  <p>When you pray then, pray thus. Thus as the Spouse with heat and love; be earnest and serious with God; and conceive not that God will heare you, when you heare not your selves. True it is, <hi>that the prayer of the righteous man prevailes much;</hi>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:200414:78"/> love of what she wanted and sued for, and would not be satisfied without she sped. <hi>Let him kiss me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There be that observe here again her humility and reverence in her suits, in that she said, <hi>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,</hi> not with the kisses of <hi>thy</hi> mouth; that phrase she thought too familiar, homely and unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly; which will check their impudence, that take upon them to command God, when they should intreat. Thus I have seen their Petitions printed, Thou Lord shalt do this for us, Thou must do it, We command thee to do it; ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their bold pride and confidence upon that place of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah; And concerning the work of my hands command ye me;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 45.11.</note> which is an Ironical Sarcasme to the <hi>Babylonians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jun. &amp; Trem. in locum.</note> that thought they might lay an interdict upon God, and stay his Decree for the return of the captivity, and no warrant for a brazen-fac'd prayer. Sure I am, that the cream of Gods servants have petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, not commanded, and thought it a great happiness, if upon a suit ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with all submission, humility and reverence, they might be heard, and dismissed with <hi>Be it unto thee as thou desirest.</hi> Familiarity begets contempt,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.28.</note> and contempt draws on anger; and in anger I deny not, but a Petition may be signed; but better it were for him, it were denied; for it proceeds <hi>à Deo irato non propitio;</hi> and what is so granted, is given as the <hi>Israelites Quails,</hi> far better be without it. Faith, though it be confident, yet it is not impudent; it blusheth when it asks; though it desires a kiss, yet it shall be modestly, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively done, approaching not as a bold Whore, but as a chaste Spouse, being prepared rather to receive, than to command a kiss.</p>
                  <p>A kisse, or kisses: And that was a great matter, as I shall by and by make evident to you. This teacheth us, that so often as we approach the Throne of Grace, we sue not for Trifles; it becomes not the Majesty of heaven to attend such Suits: <hi>Tu cum oras, magna ora:</hi> When you pray, ask for great things.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ambrose</hi> in Psal. 118. Mat. 6.33.</note>
                     <hi>First seek the Kingdom of God, and the righteousness of that Kingdom,</hi> which are the kisses the Spouse sues for in this place, and then for other matters: For one temporal ask five eternal; this is the method by which we are taught to pray, in which we have but one single petition for daily bread, but five for this one, for those things that concern Gods honour, and our souls wealth. Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory things then would be put into our petitions, as they stand in our <hi>Pater noster,</hi> not too oft repeated, nor too much insisted on; as for heavenly and spiritual, they cannot be too frequently, too earnestly pressed, because they properly concern our happiness. And among these, this especially, which the Church here asks to be reconciled to God through his Son, a work that could never have been done, had he not become the Son of man; for how should he ever have given a kiss, that had no lips? how should he speak peace, that had no mouth? when then she desires a kiss, or kiss from his mouth, her mind no question was, that he would appear in the shape of man, which was that same <hi>Magnum</hi> I hinted to you, and to that now I come.</p>

Baalam by a Star: Moses by a Prophet: David by a son: Esay by a child: Jeremy by a just God, Jehovah our righteousness: Ezekiel by a Pastor: Daniel by the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah: Micah by a Governour: Zachary by a branch:</hi> So that the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophesie; this is the light that shines in a dark place, to which he that gives heed must needs be brought to Christ.</p>

                  <p>And to him again give all the Types and Sacrifices witness; the Paschal Lamb, the Brazen Serpent, the Scape-goat, the Red Cow, and I know not how many more of them, so that the testimony of Jesus are the Types of the old Law. But all Prophesies hang in suspense till the fulfilling of them; and all Types are but shadows, empty things, till the substance be exh bited. And yet this was all the light that the old Church had; a Saviour rather shadowed out darkly, than clearly expressed; and therefore she is desirous to know fully what those darker Prophesies aimed at, and what those obscure Types intended; petitions to God to open them, and fulfill them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis as if she had said, <hi>Quo mihi semiverbia illa Prophetarum ora?</hi> What comfort can I take in those half and cloudy expressions of the Prophets?<note place="margin">Exod. 4.10.

                  <p>But it was not curiosity only that made the old Synagogue to be so earnest to see the promise fulfilled; a farther matter there was in it. God and the world for mans disobedience were fallen out; God was become angry with man, and man was an enemy to God; and betwixt both fore-told it was, that there should be a peace concluded by the lips of the womans seed:<note place="margin">Micah 4.3, 4. Isa. 9.6.</note>
                     <hi>Micah</hi> said it, that when he came, peace should be in our Land. <hi>Isaiah</hi> before him, that he should be <hi>Shar-shalon, the Prince of peace,</hi> the first that should take that burden upon his shoulders.</p>
                  <p>This was the promise, but where's the performance? some mockers there were which said, You Prophets cry peace peace, but we find no peace; How long do you torment our souls? If he your Child, your Messias will have us perswaded of his good will so often signified by you his servants, then let him come down and make the peace, make your words good, and pacifie all in heaven and earth.</p>
                  <p>Upon this <hi>Angeli pacis amarè flebant,</hi> those Messengers of peace began to weep bitterly; and as well to stop the mouths of these mockers, as to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure their own peace, they were very earnest with God. <hi>David</hi> would have the heavens bowed:<note place="margin">Psal. 144.5. Isa. 64.1. &amp;, 41.8.</note>
                     <hi>Bow the heavens O Lord, and come down.

                     <hi>Alas, who shall live when God doth this?</hi> those that lived near his coming, as <hi>Zachary, Simeon, Anna,</hi> were always looking and expecting this day.

                  <p>And now let us see what those kisses were which she so much desired, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they were; <hi>Oscula,</hi> a plurality of kisses; which when we know, confess we shall that not one of them could be spared, for we stood in need of them all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first kiss he gave to our nature whereby he took the seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and join'd it to his Deity, so of two making one, of two natures, that of God, and that of man, one person. By this there was a stay made of that pollution or birth-sin that defiles our nature. By this an infusion of that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and holiness which was requisite in a Mediatour; for had he been any way defiled with sin himself, he never could have reconciled God to sinners.</p>
                  <p>In his person there was the grace of union, and the grace of unction; and because the first of union, therefore this latter of unction; the conjunction of our dust to his Deity, raised our clay to a higher pitch,<note place="margin">Thom.

'Tis acutely observed by <hi>Rupert,</hi>

                  <p>But because this work could never be done without this union,<note place="margin">Psal. 49.7.</note> therefore he decreed that these two natures should meet and kiss. <hi>Man cannot redeem his brother;</hi> it is a work too high for him, he must let that alone for ever; God is unapt to do it, as having no blood to shed,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9.22.</note> without which there can be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.

And yet we have another kiss from his lips, a kiss of Instruction, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity in this kiss; for the same word <hi>Nazak</hi> in the Original, that signifies to kiss, signifies to instruct also. Instructed he hath, and taught us now a new lesson, yea, and that from his own mouth; for saith the Apostle, <hi>God hath spoken to us by his Son.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 1.2.</note> The old lesson we had from his Messengers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets; but this not from any man of God, though never so eminent, but from the Lord of the Prophets; not from any servant, though never so great in place, but from the Son himself; from his mouth we have received notice of Gods will; he himself, <hi>ore tenus,</hi> gave us this kiss.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now the last kiss he gives, is a parting kiss, a comfortable kiss indeed, without which we should take out farewel of the world with small content: Did not he come, when we are passing from these houses of earth, and seal upon our lips, <hi>Osculum pacis,</hi> the kiss of peace, pronouncing with a clear voice, and a serene countenance, <hi>Pax tibi frater,</hi> Peace be to thee my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; assuring us that through his blood our Father is reconciled to us, and we to him, without which we should pass hence with a sad and amazed soul. Did you ever behold the chearful look, and the Swan-like song of a Saint of God upon the approach of grim-fac'd death?<note place="margin">Luke 2.29.</note> that which caused him to sing his <hi>Nunc dimittis</hi> with such content, was the assurance of this kiss. On the other side, have you ever been by to hear the groans and pitiful complaints, not of men of the common sort, but of spirit and valour, that durst have looked death in the face,<note place="margin">Isa. 38.1, 14.</note> yet upon the Summons, <hi>Set thy house in order, for thou shalt dye,</hi> brought so low, that they mourn as a Dove, and chatter as a Swallow? That which struck them into this terror, was, that they could find no inward certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of this kiss. It is no light thing then that the Spouse here sues for, since to it is annexed all our comfort; since when it is either denied or with-held, there is nothing but the greatest discomfort and perplexity.</p>
                  <p>A kiss is the perfectest Symbol of love and amity, and given from the lips of Christ most sure. Among men it may be, as they are, deceitful; for there is a crafty and insinuating kiss,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.5. Mat. 26.49.</note> as was <hi>Absoloms;</hi> and a false and treacherous kiss, as was that of <hi>Judas;</hi> but in God there cannot be the least suspition of falshood, no ill intent; and therefore from his mouth a kiss given, must needs be <hi>Charitatis Symbolum,</hi> a sure sign of love and peace.</p>

Now how was it possible, but as they saw the light arise by little and little, so also they should still be desirous to see more of it, indeed to behold it in its full strength and beauty, without which they could not be satisfied? All they heard of him hitherto, except that intimation given to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> was immediatly from the mouth of man.

                  <p>To kisse Christs feet, or his hands, belongs to us; when we adore him, we kisse his feet; when we submit to him, we kisse his hands, and are both a duty in us: But to give a kisse with his mouth, that is to be reconcil'd to us, only belongs to him, and is no otherwise a duty laid upon us, but that we be earnest and instant to obtain it. And to say truth, the sole way to purchase this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is to begin with his feet, and go on to his hands.</p>

                  <p>This kisse of the feet is for Penitents, which yet, when we have sadly given, it becomes us not presently to be over-hasty or presumptuous to challenge that of his mouth. Ther'es another kisse to be given by the way, a middle duty; the hand is then offer'd, and we must remember to kisse that. For what? thou wast but yesterday polluted with blood, and wilt thou presume to touch his lips? but now thou layst grovling at his feet loaden with, and confessing thy deformities, and wilt thou presently be so bold as to approach his mouth? Take his hand in the way, and kisse that; Pray humbly, that with his hand he may raise thee, with his hand uphold thee, with his hand assist thee, that thy hands which before were instruments of iniquity, may hereafter be hands of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, dedicated wholly to his service, to his honour.</p>
                  <p>When we have thus humbly done our parts, kissed his feet with penitent tears,<note place="margin">Nehem. 2.8.</note> and humble souls; and kissed his hands in acknowledgment of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.16.</note> telying wholly upon the good hand of God for power to execute our begun resolutions: Then we may the more boldly come to the throne of grace,<note place="margin">Luke. 7.48. 2 Cor. 12.9.</note> and beg a kisse of his mouth from him. Say it be that of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Thy sinnes are forgiven thee.</hi> Say it be that to Saint <hi>Paul, My grace is sufficient for thee,</hi> yet there is great comfort in it; for as it follows in the close of this <hi>verse, his love is better than wine.</hi> A Pardon pronounced by his lips, and a sufficiency of grace assured by his promise, is farre beyond the delights of all earthly delicates.<note place="margin">Cant. 1.14.</note> Talk no more then of the clusters of <hi>Engeddi,</hi> name not to me the Valleys loaden with Wheat, nor the Fields with Olives; These may please and content for a time, be some comfort rather to a living, than a dying man.<note place="margin">Luke 2.29.</note> While I live and breath, and at that instant when I shall breath my last, the Lord afford me this kisse, and seale his love upon my lips and soul, that I may depart in peace.</p>

For I am assured, that a kisse of reconciliation will be a better cordial to my now panting heart, and then parting soul, than all the pleasures of <hi>Solomon,</hi> or the treasures of <hi>Tyre.</hi> Evermore therefore Lord give me of this comfort, kisse me with the kisses of thy mouth, that I may live in peace, and dye in peace, and rest in peace, and enjoy the fruits of this peace for ever and ever. Farre be it from your heart to imagine me so uncharitable, as that I have not included you in this my desire; for know that I wish you no worse than my self; why is it that I spend this breath, but that Christ should have his kisses from you, and you again your kisses from him? He his of adoration and submission, and you yours of reconciliation and peace. Go toward him,<note place="margin">Luke 15.20.</note> and make your tender of them, as did the Prodigal, and then though you be a great way off, he will fall upon your neck, and give you his kisse. Nothing can hinder you from it, but your undervaluing of it; which if you do, I shall hold you unworthy of so great a grace, so great love, so great a benefit, But I hope better things of you, and that you are as ambitious of it, as he ready to give it.

               <p>THere was a three-fold error and mistake about our Saviour; the first was the time of his coming; the second was about his condition in which he was to come; The third concerning his person when he was come.</p>
               <p n="1">1. About the time the obstinate Jew yet errs grossely, for they deny that the Messiah is yet come,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> though they have seene the Scepter departed from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;</hi> though they have read all the Prophecies fulfilled in him; though they feele his blood upon them and their children,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.15.</note> which descends four times a year constantly, as the late converted Jew hath discovered to us; though their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies be lost, their Temple and City razed, and themselves dispersed to the four winds, yet there is a vaile over their hearts, another they look for, and will not be taught, that our Christ was the Messiah, who was sent in the fulnesse of time to save the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that which then did, and yet doth animate them in their error, is, the low estate, and meane condition in which Christ came. For they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great Prince for their Messiah, a temporal and worldly King;<note place="margin">Isa. 53.</note> quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which the Prophets, especially I <hi>say</hi> hath left written of him. And to this day they continue in this error; for they give it out, that their Messiah shall be a mighty warriour; restore the Kingdome of <hi>David</hi> to its, wonted dignity; build their Sanctuary and City; and gather all the dispersed Jews to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Both these mistakes are great, but the greatest was <hi>error personae,</hi> the mistake about his person when he was come. About which that there be no more mistakes, our Saviour proposeth to his Disciples two questions.</p>
               <p>One at <hi>verse</hi> 13. <hi>Whom do men say that I the Sonne ef man am?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 13.</note> He confesseth himself to be the Sonne of man, and closely intimates, that this was it that gave the cause of offence; because they beheld him in a low degree,<note place="margin">Isa. 53.2, 3.</note> therefore they took occasion to esteeme him as an object and contemptible person. Gladly therfore he would know of his Disciples what opinion the world had of him.</p>
               <p>To which question they return this answer,<note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> that men were not of one opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, divided they were, and <hi>some said this, and some said that; some said that he was John the Baptist newly risen from the dead; some Eliah,</hi> whom the Jewes expected; <hi>some Jeremiah;</hi> or if none of these,<note place="margin">Montacat. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalect. Exc. <hi>3.</hi> sect. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> yet at least <hi>one of the old Prophets.</hi> And I little doubt, but that this their conjecture took its rise from that Pharisaical phancy then current, that the souls of good men pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into other good mens bodies, and therefore possible it was, that Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy might be animated by the soul either of <hi>John, Elias,</hi> or <hi>Jeremiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:200414:83"/>
               <p>Though this their judgement were erroneous, yet 'tis an argument that the people yet had an honourable esteeme of him. For we hear no news here of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the wonted blasphemies of the Pharisees thrown in his face;<note place="margin">Matth. 11.19. John 8.48.</note> Not that he is <hi>a wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and sinners;</hi> not that <hi>he is a Samaritan, and hath a Devil.</hi> Though they err'd foully; yet it was with an honest minde, their thoughts were honourable, though low, and imperfect; therefore he turns to his Disciples, and would needs know their judgement of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But whom say you that I am?</hi> As if he had said, the former conjectures are all false, be it that by them they shew some love and good will to me, yet I am nor one, nor t'other. You now are my Disciples, have been thus long with me, seen my miracles, heard my words, publiquely, privately you have conversed with me; <hi>Quid vos tandem?</hi> What say you to this question? which was no sooner propos'd, but <hi>Peter</hi> steps forth, <hi>&amp; prae omnibus, &amp; pro omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> for all, and before all makes this Confession, <hi>Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</hi> This is the occasion and coherence of these words, out of which I propose to your consideration</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Question, which is Emphatical; for there is one Emphasis in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Adversative particle, another in <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. The answer by way of Confession, which is Emphatical also, for every word hath his Article. <hi>Thou art.</hi> Thou, and no other besides thee, art, not a Christ, but <gap reason="foreign">

                  <note place="margin">Prov. 27.19.</note> since face doth not more answer in water to face, than this his Confession is answerable to that Article, and that Article to this Confession, as will farther appear by the farther examination of it.</p>

                  <p>But first a word of the question, which is here proposed to the Disciples, not to the people. In doubts and difficulties that arise in matters of faith, we are not to seek for resolutions from ordinary men, but apply our selves to such as Christ hath taken nearer to him, and enquire of them. This man saith this, and th'other man saith that, <hi>But what say you?</hi> Of the Lawyer we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire about our estate, and consult we will with the Physitian about our health, and must the Divine be laid aside only, when a Quaere ariseth in his professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Had this doubt here been moved to any of the people, 'tis evident what the answer had been; honest perhaps, and according to their knowledge, but yet far short of the Truth.</p>
                  <p>God hath ordained a higher Keeper of Divine Mysteries. The Priests lips, saith he shall preserve knowledge,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.7. Hagg. 2.11. 1 Kings 7.29. <hi>Greg.</hi>
                     </note> preserve it and have it ready in store; and then follows the peoples duty, <hi>and thou shalt enquire the Law at his mouth.</hi> In the Bases of the Temple there were Lions, Oxen, and Cherubins, of which a Father makes this Moral, those whom God has taken near to him, are the Bases of the Church, and endued they must be with the valour of Lions, the pains and patience of the Oxe,<note place="margin">Exod. 28.30.</note> and with the knowledge of a Cherub. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they must about them what the High Priest did in the Breastplate, <hi>Ʋrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:200414:83"/> power of Judicature for himself, but for the benefit of another. Doctrine is necessary that he judge wisely; and truth is requisite that he resolve honestly; but both these are of no farther use than to informe himself, if no man refer himself to his judgement. Remember then, it is not arbitrary in you, left to your choice whether you will ask or no, but a duty. His lips shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; Thou shalt enquire. As he must be able by sound doctrine, both to exhort and to convince the gain-sayers:<note place="margin">Tit. 1.9. 1 Cor. 14.16.</note> so must he (whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>

                  <p>Into the Godhead then was the Manhood taken, and both together make one Person, yet so, that the Natures are preserved without confusion, and the Person entire without division; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Christ then, that did really subsist before in the Nature of God, took the seed of our Nature, which had no personal subsistence before, and joyned it to his Deity, that so being united to his Person, it might have the same subsistence which he had.

                     </gap>, God and man.</p>
                  <p>This we usually call the grace of union, and the personal subsistence of these two natures are explained to us under many Similes,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Incar. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi>

                  <p>Now from this union of our Nature to the Person of the Son of God, there ariseth to us these priviledges or benefits.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is, the Exaltation of our Nature even above all creatures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, not the Angels themselves excepted, in that now it hath its subsistence in the second Person of the Trinity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second is, that which Divines call the communication of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but this must be taken with a grain of salt, for here was no real donation by which one Nature might use the properties of the other; for whatsoever was proper to the Deity,<note place="margin">Hook. lib. <hi>5.</hi> Sect. <hi>54.</hi>
                     </note> was not communicated to the Humanity; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was natural to the Manhood, the Deity was not capable of. This then is that we affirme, that the properties which really and essentially belong to either Nature, are attributed to the whole Person. 'Tis proper unto God to be immutable, impassible, immortal; yet because God dwelt in our flesh, we may say, that he that was God, was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, God dyed for us, because the Person in which the Godhead dwelt, was born, and dyed. Again, we may truly say that man is Omnipotent, Eternal, Omniscious, because that Person to whom we attribute these properties of the Deity, had the Nature of God as well as the Nature of man in him; so that all the actions and passions of Christ are to be referred properly unto his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the Predications to be understood of his Person, as the true subject in which they do exist, though some of them must be referred to one Nature, some to the other, as the principle and cause from which they flow. The Rule in Logick is true, and of excellent use in this Point: <hi>Quod est partis, qua pars, id etiam totius est secundum illam partem;</hi> that property which belongs essentially to any part, may be attributed to the whole in respect of that part: Both Propositions then are true, Christ dyed, and Christ dyed not; for Christ is the whole, and the Godhead and Manhood are as it were the parts; here what belongs to a part only, is attributed to the whole and truly; for he dyed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Manhood, but he dyed not according to his Godhead: And thus the properties of either Nature may be safe, and yet communicated to the whole.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lastly, By reason of this union it is, that the Godhead of Christ works all things in that great business of our redemption in and by the Manhood. Thus he became <hi>the way, the truth, and the life;</hi> thus <hi>wisdome, righteousness, sanctification,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 14.6. 2 Cor. 1.30. Acts 28.20. Hebr. 1.2. Col. 1.18.</note>
                     <hi>redemption;</hi> thus he became <hi>the peace of the world, the hope of the Fathers, the heir of all things, the supreme head of the Church:</hi> The man Christ and Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> is the subject and person upon which these honours and prerogatives are bestowed, but not simply as he is man, but as a man with whom Deity is personally joyned. <hi>The flesh profiteth nothing,</hi> yet by vertue which it receiveth from the person to which it is joyned, it is quickning flesh, and the bread of life; which one point of Christian belief, is the very ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of all things believed concerning life and salvation.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Job 15.15.</note> somewhat that was awry. They need a Redeemer and Saviour themselves, and what they need themselves, they cannot supply to others.

                     <hi>It is God that redeems my soul from the power of hell.</hi> For he that will redeem, must necessarily do these four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He must give a full price for that which he will redeem; lay down he must whatsoever can be demanded, or else the person to whom the forfeiture is made, may choose whether he will set free or no. This <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, this price God only was able to lay down, and therefore God only a Redeemer; and this he did lay down, whence it is written, <hi>God redeemed the Church with his own blood.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. He must make amends for the wrong that was done to the offended par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and repair him in point of honour, if in justice it be demanded. The wrong that was here done to Almighty God by sin, was infinite, an infinite dishonour; for which he exacting reparation, it could never be had from a finite creature; and therefore he that would undertake to restore this honour, must be God alone.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For this infinite wrong, God was infinitely angry, and in his anger he threatned an infinite and eternal punishment. The satisfaction for this must be correspondent, which had it light upon any creature, he would have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed and crushed with it; God then he must be that should undergo this wrath; God, that he might overcome, and not sink under this punishment, which was, and is rightly call'd infinite, because sustained by such a person, that makes it equivalent to an eternal.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Lastly, He that will redeem, must set the person so at liberty, that he be <hi>in statu quo prius,</hi> in as good an estate as he was at first, for else his work is but done by halfs. The state in which man at first was, was very glorious;<note place="margin">Col. 3.10. Ephes. 4.24.</note> for <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated he was in the image of God, in righteousness and true holiness.</hi> Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this was, utterly lost and repaired it must be, or else he shall never be able to appear <hi>rectus in Curiâ,</hi> a holy and a righteous creature, when the Judge shall sit on the Bench. Now can any thing we do repair it? Alas no, for <hi>all our righteousness is but a filthy rag, and our specious works as dung:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 64.6. Phil. 3.8.</note> That which will purge away this filth, must be the blood of the Son of God, this alone can restore the image of God in us, and make us appear holy and righteous creatures; whence the Prophet teacheth us a Name by which we are to call him, <hi>Jehovah our righteousness;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 23.6. Phil. 3.9.</note>
                     <hi>Jehovah</hi> you see must be an ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or else our righteousness will fall short.</p>
                  <p>Whether then we consider the price to be paid, the wrong to be satisfied, the punishment to be sustained, or our wicked and perverse nature to be rectified and restored; necessary it is that he who would undertake to do this, be God, or else he could be no Redeemer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. On the other side, if a Redeemer of men, man he must be also; so is the flat redemption of persons. He must be a brother, or next of blood, else not admitted to redeem a person. <hi>Job</hi> took notice of this in that <hi>chap.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Levit. 25.25.</note> where we first meet with this word <hi>Redeemer, I know that my Redeemer liveth;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 19.25.</note> for the word is very Emphatical, <hi>Goel,</hi> it is that signifieth a <hi>Kinsman,</hi> near al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:200414:87"/> to him, of his own flesh, as well as a <hi>Redeemer;</hi> and I doubt not that the Spouse had an eye to this in her earnest desire for his Incarnation; <hi>Oh that thou wert as my brother,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 8.1.</note>
                     <hi>sucking the breasts of my mother;</hi> her <hi>brother</hi> saith she; his <hi>kinsman</hi> saith <hi>Job,</hi> or else no <hi>redeemer;</hi> for</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He that would redeem a man from the breach of the Law, must himself come under the Law;<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> for if he be out of the compass of the Law, the Law cannot take hold of him. No remedy then but he who would undertake our debt and danger which the Law exacted of us, must put and bind himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, that so he might perform whatever the Law required at our hands, and where we fell short pay for all our misdemeanours, and bear the stripes we deserved. This was impossible for the Deity; for he cannot be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nor cannot suffer; since then it pleased him to be our Surety, and to enter bond for us, necessary it was that he should be man, to do what we should have done; and suffer what we should have suffered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God and man were fallen at variance; and requisite it was that some one should step in, and work a reconciliation. God was the offended Party, and of too high a Nature for such a work:<note place="margin">Leo de pass. ser. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> Man was the offending person, and no way capable to treat. 'Tis the <hi>Medium</hi> that unites the extreams; and such an one was Christ, the <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt God and man, and so compos'd of both,<note place="margin">1 John 2.1. Hebr. 7.25. Rev. 8.3.</note> that he came betwixt both. As God, speaks to the Father for us, and presents our prayers to him; but man, that God might speak to us, and we to God by Christ. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediatour betwixt God and man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5.</note>
                     <hi>the man Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But praying would not serve the turn; there must be paying also; a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made with blood;<note place="margin">Hebr. 9.22.</note> for <hi>without shedding of blood there is no remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi> but God had no blood to shed. Dye he could not, nor shed blood he could not, had he only continued to be the Son of God. He must then become also the Son of man,<note place="margin">Hebr. 2.9.</note>
                     <hi>that he might partake of death for man,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we had layen under the curse still.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet farther, man he would be, that we thereby might have strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation; for had not this been, he could never have been one with us, and we with him, which is the sole ground of our comfort; for by this union it is <hi>that we are made partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4. Hebr. 2.11. &amp; 2.17. &amp; 4.15.</note> God is become our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Christ our elder Brother; he the Sanctifier, and we the Saints; <hi>and he that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified, are all one.</hi> He then must be like to us in all things, <hi>sin only excepted,</hi> or else our Brotherhood, our Filiation, our Sanctification, our Kindred, our Fellowship with him is quite gone, and with that all our hope and confidence.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And yet there is one reason more, which is, that that Nature might be a means to work the peace which had made the breach; and that nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Divel, that was conquered by the Divel. 1. It was the Nature of man that in <hi>Adam</hi> did transgress; and it was the Nature of man in Christ that must and did satisfie.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> As by man came sin, so by man Redemption from sin. And this seems to belong to Justice, that he should satisfie who hath sinned: <hi>Et ideo in natura per peccatum co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Leo Serm. <hi>2.</hi> de Nativit.</note> and this is <hi>Leo</hi>'s Reason. 2. But then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this Nature of man had not only been seduced and corrupted, but tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon, captivated and enslaved by the Divel; that then the same Nature might conquer that had been conquered, and triumph which had been led captive, it pleased God to joyne himself to our Nature, and in it to give the Divel a deadly blow,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> and as it was promised, <hi>to break the Serpents head;</hi> and this belonged to the wisdome and goodness of the Creator, <hi>ut per eandem cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aturam superaretur Diabolus, quam se superasse gaudebat;</hi> That the Divel should be conquered by that self-same creature,<note place="margin">August. lib. <hi>13.</hi> de Trin. cap. <hi>18.</hi>

                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:200414:87"/>
                  <p>Sum up all this, and the total will be, that it was necessary (Gods Decree being presupposed, for of absolute necessity I speak not) that the Redeemer of men should be a man, that he might come under the Law, might be fitted to be a Mediatour, might have blood to shed, might in our Nature satisfie and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the wrath of God, conquer and triumph over the Divel, and be made one with his Church.</p>
                  <p>Oh the infinite riches of the wisdome and mercy of Almighty God, who so fitted a Person to this great work of mans Redemption, in whom both these Natures are combined, the Godhead and the Manhood! Man, that he might have wherewith to pay; and God, that this his payment might be fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory; never such a person, never such a price, never such a mercy: <hi>By this we have accesse to the Throne of Grace,</hi> where we receive this comfort,<note place="margin">Hebr. 4.15, 16. &amp; 5.2.</note> that being man, he will be more pitiful to man, fit to be a Mediator; and being God, <hi>able to finish the work of our salvation to the uttermost.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 7.25.</note> Both together make him to be the Saviour of the world, to which he was anointed, and was therefore called Christ, or as <hi>Peter</hi> here stiles him, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>THis is that other Title given by <hi>Peter</hi> to our Saviour; and as the former was <hi>Nomen Naturae,</hi> so is this <hi>Officii;</hi> that expressed to us his Nature, this his Office; that was peculiar and proper to him; for never was any so the Son of God as he was. This is an appellative or common name given to others, because they were Types and Figures of him, and bore those Offices in their times, which he for ever executes in his Church. It is all one with Messiah in Hebrew, whereby the Redeemer was named in the Old Testament; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that name the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> as the other Jewes expected him:<note place="margin">Dan. 9.15.

                     <hi>I know that the Messiah comes, which is called Christ.</hi> The Hebrew, Greek and Latine signifie no more than <hi>anointed</hi> in English; whence <hi>Tertullian</hi> made a doubt whether it be a name or no: <hi>Si tamen nomen est Christus, &amp; non poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us appellatio;</hi> if yet it be, saith he, a name, and not rather an appellation, as are other denominatives; be it then no more, yet it is an appellation both of Office and Honour.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of Office, Trust and Charge; for he was a Saviour <hi>ex Officio;</hi> at his coming into the world God erected an Office of salvation. Some before him had been temporal and particular saviours as it fell out; but none ordained, none so sanctified, none so commissioned fully to execute that Office besides himself;<note place="margin">Isa. 42.1. Joh. 3.17. Joh. 6.27.</note> he was elected, called, sent, anointed, sealed to exercise this function of a Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as it is a Name of Office, so also is it a Title of Honour and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for though some had it before his coming, yet never any bore it, but such as were in some honourable place, and high calling. Kings were called <hi>Christi,</hi> and Priests were called <hi>Christi,</hi> and Prophets were <hi>Christi,</hi> Christs, or anointed; the calling of all three before our time was never questioned to be very hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; Christ therefore is a Name of Dignity: <hi>Quod propter eximiam ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam praecellentiam conferebatur;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieron.</note> which was conferred for some signal prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence; for those three above-named bore the title in regard of the unction, because by the external Ceremony of anointing, they were all three consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and enabled to the execution of their Office. The Office of the King is in temporal things chiefly, to Judge, to Rule, to Defend his People; to set all right, and keep all right; to save his people from those who would hurt, and to help the innocent. The Office of the Priest lies in spiritual matters; to stand in the gap, to pacifie, and reconcile man to God, and God to man.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:200414:88"/> The Office of the Prophet is to illuminate and direct, and by this light and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to save our feet from the by-paths of Error, and our souls from the fire of hell. Kings, Priests, and Prophets then were put into these high places to save;<note place="margin">Lev. 8.12. 1 Kings 19.16. 1 Sam. 16.13.</note> and all these three had their several anointings; <hi>Aaron</hi> the Priest, <hi>Elisha</hi> the Prophet, <hi>David</hi> the King.</p>
                  <p>But when Jesus came into the world, because he was to do the Office of all these three, therefore was he called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the Anointed,</hi> in a more peculiar manner than they were; for they were anointed with material oyle, he with the Holy Ghost; they by the hands of men, he by no other than God himself; they to save for a time, he to save for ever.</p>
                  <p>They were typical, he a perfect Christ; in him all those Offices were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, which in them were never perfectly to be found. Two of these met in some one or other, but in none of them all three. <hi>Melchizedech</hi> was King and Priest, but no Prophet; <hi>David</hi> Prophet and King, but no Priest; <hi>Samuel</hi> Priest and Prophet,<note place="margin">Psal. 110.4. Deut. 18.18. Dan. 9.25. Luke 1.33.</note> but no King; he the sole perfect Christ, because all three. <hi>Davids</hi> Priest: <hi>Moses</hi> Prophet: <hi>Daniels</hi> King; for he was to reign in the house of <hi>Jacob</hi> for ever.</p>
                  <p>Farther yet, this name of honour was given to him in a more eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, because in him alone are contained the causes of that unction, for which those other were honoured with the Name of Christ; for he was by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office to teach and instruct in the whole will of God. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 61.1. Luke 4.18.</note>
                     <hi>because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tydings to the meek, &amp;c.</hi> By his Priesthood to purge, to expiate, to offer a Sacrifice for us, to reconcile us again to God, to mediate for us, and bless us; and by his Kingly power to subdue his enemies of all sorts; to protect his Church; to prescribe wholsome Laws by which he would govern it; to reward the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and punish the breakers of them; but of this more at large by and by.</p>

Which when <hi>in the fulnesse of time</hi> it was effected,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> then by the concurrence and good will of all three persons, he was anointed, and had the name of Christ given him; The Sonne of God he was before, but not <gap reason="foreign">

                     </list> This I touched before, but now I will speak more fully of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Than the Grace of Union there could be no greater bestowed on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man. For besides the Sanctification of it, how farre hath God honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our clay, by joyning his Deity to our dust? By this Union God and earth, Majesty and infirmity, power and weaknesse cohabit and dwell together. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil Deo sublimius, nil limo vilius.</hi> Nothing is higher than God, nothing baser than earth or dust,<note place="margin">Bern. in Vigil.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>od hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to our earth, and with so great honour our earth hath ascended to God, that whatsoever God hath done in it, that our earth and dust is said to have done; and whatsoever our earth suffered, God is beleeved to have borne it out. By reason of this Union it is, that God hath put all things into his hands.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.10. John 5.26.</note> The name which he hath above every name is given unto him, yea and he hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to bequeath life to whom he pleaseth.</p>
                  <p>The Union then of the flesh to the Deity, is to the flesh a principal grace and favour; for by vertue of this Grace man is really united to God, made an associate of the Deity, partaker of Divine power, a creature is exalted above the dignity of all creatures, and hath all creatures made subject to it.<note place="margin">Leo.</note>
                     <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosce O homo Christiane dignitatem tuam, &amp; divinae consors factus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae, dole in veterem vilitatem degeneri conversatione redire.</hi> O Christian man take notice of thy dignity, and being made a partaker of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, think thy self too good to degenerate and return to thy old baseness by a sordid and sinful life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But to come to the grace of Unction; Did the two parts of our Nature, the soul and body of Christ, receive from the influence of the Deity, whereto they were conjoyned, no ability of operation, no vertue or quality above Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? yes verily; for otherwise the Holy Ghost had never taught the holy men of God thus to write, <hi>that he was anointed above his fellows;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 45. John 1.14. Ephes. 1.</note>
                     <hi>that he was full of grace and truth; that it pleased the Father that in him all fulness should dwell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Grace then, as the Schoolmen have well observed,<note place="margin">Thom. part. <hi>3.</hi> q. <hi>7.</hi> Art. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note> is to be considered two ways; <hi>vel ex parte gratiae, vel ex parte subjecti habentis gratiam;</hi> either in respect of grace it self, or the subject in which grace is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The fulness of grace in respect of grace it self, is, when one cometh to the highest pitch of grace, both <hi>quoad essentiam, &amp; quoad virtutem, &amp; extensivè, &amp; intensivè;</hi> both so far as it may be had, and to all the effects and purposes to which it may extend; as he that hath life in all the perfections, must have whatsoever the vegetative, the sensitive soul, or what reason can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to him. This kind of grace is proper unto Christ alone; for God gave not the Spirit unto him by measure, or in any small scantling.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the fulness of grace in respect of the subject, is, when one hath gracefully and perfectly, according to his estate and condition; intensively, according to his rank; and extensively, according to the duties and offices which God requires from men of his rank. And thus <hi>Mary, Stephen,</hi>

                  <p>Their graces were then limited, Christs without limitation; theirs in measure,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.7. John 1.33.</note> his had no stint, no bounds. Whence Saint <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>that the holy Ghost did descend and remaine upon him.</hi> The Deity (the essential properties of the Godhead only excepted) imparted to the humanity all things,<note place="margin">John 1.14.</note> replenished it with all such perfections according to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of that oeconomy and service, for which it pleased him in love and mercy to be made man.</p>
                  <p>And these graces and qualities subjectively, habitually, and formally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the Humane Nature of Christ, are in particular aptly typed out to us by that Holy Oyle which <hi>Moses</hi> was commanded to make after the Art of the Apothecary, and reserve for the Unction of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes, when they were to be consecrated to the Priests Office.<note place="margin">Exod. 30.22.</note> And that in three respects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Holy Oyle had no man for its Authour, but God alone: So the supereminent graces in the Manhood of Christ, have no other beginning or fountaine save his very Deity.<note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">Isa. 11.1, 2.</note>2. Though that Oyle were more precious, yet the composition was of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly substances, as Myrrh, Cinnamon, Cassia, Calamus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to signifie that the spiritual Oyle of grace, whereof the Man-hood of Christ was as it were, the Vessel or Store-house, did not consist of the essential properties of his Deity, but in certain habitual gifts and graces resident in his Humane Nature; otherwise we could not have had our parts in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Oyle was a most fragrant perfume, sending forth a most sweet smelling savour. This was a most lively resemblance of the graces of Christ, which are a sweet smelling savour in the nostrils of the Almighty, which doth sente our persons and actions,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.2.</note> and make them so acceptable to him, that the strong vapours of our stinking sinnes are no more loathsome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury to him.

                     <hi>3.</hi> The Charge and Trust by this Office committed to him.</head>
                  <p>I am past the two first points, his <hi>Consecration,</hi> and his <hi>Endowments;</hi> It remaines now that I speak of that threefold Office to which he was anointed; that of a <hi>King,</hi> that of a <hi>Priest,</hi> and that of a <hi>Prophet.</hi> And there is very great reason for this number.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Fist, In that man by his Apostacy from God, became ignorant and knew not, an enemy and would not, so impotent that he could not return of himself againe to him. By these Offices there is a present remedy set forth for all these. As a <hi>Prophet,</hi> he teacheth us knowledge, and so cures our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: As a <hi>Priest,</hi> he takes up all matters of difference and dislike, makes God our friend, and so removes all enmity: And as a <hi>King,</hi> he empowers us with strength, and enables us to conquer and overcome all difficulties and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments that are cast in the way of our return.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, the Method of Gods bestowing salvation requires this number. For this mystery of our Redemption ought first to be expounded, then paid for, and lastly be applyed to us. Now who fitter than a Prophet to open and expound the Will of God to his people? who than a Priest to offer a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and by it to make God amends for sinne? what person so fit as a King, who hath power in his hand to apply to every one what is needful? And all this he did; As a <hi>Prophet</hi> he made known, as a <hi>Priest</hi> he paid, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:200414:89"/> as a <hi>King</hi> he applyed his whole Ransome and Satisfaction, and made it ours.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lastly, These three Offices appeare in the orderly execution of them. For first as a <hi>Prophet</hi> he walkt about, at least for three years, publishing and preaching the glad tydings of the Gospel. Then as a <hi>Priest</hi> he offer'd his soul a Sacrifice for sinne upon the Altar of the Cross. And lastly having conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his and our enemies, Sinne, Death, and Hell, as a <hi>King</hi> he entred tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly into his glory, and took possession of his Crown. But it will not be amiss to speak of these more particularly.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. He purg'd the Law from divers corruptions,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.21, 22, &amp;c.</note> which the false glosses of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had put upon it; and in that excellent Sermon upon the Mount, and through the whole Gospel sets down an Exacter Rule of life than any Law-giver ever before him thought of, or at least so obscurely, that their injunctions were not well understood, much lesse ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>

                  <p>And in two things it is that he hath the preheminence of all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he was in the bosome of his Father,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.27.

                     </gap>ed to deliver the whole Will of God to us;<note place="margin">Joh. 16.13, 14, 15.</note> whereas all other Prophets and Teachers receive their Revelation at the second hand, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grace given them by the Spirit of Christ, searching what,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.10. &amp; 12.7. ad 13. 1 Pet. 1.11.</note> or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them would signifie. The gift of Prophecy in him then was <hi>per modum habitus;</hi> a habit it was, so that he could work by it, so that he could reveale the secrets of God, where, when, to whom, and as he would: But in other Prophets it was only <hi>per modum coruscationis &amp; actus,</hi> a light that shined into their understanding for the present, so that they could not prophecy when they pleased, or speak
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:200414:90"/> what they list, but only so much, and at that time when God inform'd them. In a word, Prophecy in Christ was like the light in the Sun; but in any of his Messengers, like the same light in the aire, which you know vanisheth when the Sun is set.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                     <hi>but except the Lord build the house, their labour is but lost that build it;</hi> for who is able to breath that Spirit of life into those cold stones but he? who can make the dead in their graves heare the voice of the Sonne of God but he?<note place="margin">Joh. 5.25.

He opens to the two Disciples the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and their hearts glow within them. This then is another priviledge he hath beyond any other Prophet; that whereas he can only declare and speak, Christ can give Spirit, life, and power to his Word, and make it so effectual to the conversion of the hearer,<note place="margin">Isa. 55.11.</note> that it returns not empty.</p>

                     <hi>2.</hi> Christ a Priest.</head>
                  <p>Which yet will be more evident, if we consider his second Office, that of a Priest. For the Office of a Priest lies in this especially, that he interpose and mediate; that he offer Sacrifice, that he do bless the people. For we know in the old Law,<note place="margin">Numb. 16.46. Lev. 3.11. &amp; 4.7, 16. Num. 6.23.</note> if at any time God and his people were faln out, the Priest was to stand in the Gap to pray for them, and to mediate a peace. Then againe to purge and expiate their sinne by Sacrifice. Lastly, to bless them. And all these wayes Christ may well be called a Priest by his Mediation, his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and Benediction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5.</note>First, He mediates; <hi>for there is but one Mediatour betwixt God and man, the man Christ Jesus.</hi> Now mediation is nothing else but an act by which one interposeth himself betwixt two that are at variance to reconcile them, and joyn them in a new League of amity or friendship. This media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is performed foure wayes. First, By discerning and judging the matters of quarrel and dislike, that separate and estrange the parties. Secondly, By making report to either party the conditions on which the peace should be made, and the differences ended. Thirdly, By entreating one party for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And fourthly, by satisfying one party for the wrong done by the other. Now all these ways was Christ a Mediatour.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For first he interposed himself as an Arbitratour between God and us, and easily discern'd the whole matter of dislike, and judg'd it to be most equal on the part of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then he reported the conditions upon which the dislike might be taken up; to wit, that we should submit to God, prostrate our selves at his feet, repent of the wrongs we did him, beg mercy, believe those promises of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don he should make us, and enter into a Solemne Obligation, never wilfully hereafter to reject his Laws, or wrong him any more, upon which conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons God should accept of our submission, faith, repentance, and purpose of amendment.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Lastly, He mediated by satisfying the one party for the wrong done by the other, which could be done only by Sacrifice, and so he perform'd the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duty of the Priest.</p>

                        </gap>es for sinnes:</hi> Ordained then it is, that every Priest offer a Sacrifice; This then is common to him with <hi>Aaron,</hi> that he offer'd; but that Sacrifice which he offer'd, farre exceeds that of <hi>Aarons</hi> and of his family.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.7. Heb. 9.12, 25, 26. &amp; 13.</note> They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd first for themselves, he for the people only; for, for himself he needed not. They often, he but once; They somewhat else, as Bulls, Goats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he offer'd himself for the Sinnes of the world, to a painful and shameful death, by which he did satisfie God for the injuries and wrongs done him by sinful men, and repair him in point of honour, so far as ungodly wretches had dishonoured him.</p>
                  <p>A Priest that would undertake this, must needs be such a person as Christ was. Man: that he might be a Sacrifice, shed his blood, and dye, which God could not. God: that the effusion of this blood, might be a price sufficient and valuable for the sinne of man. For though the Sacrifice was offer'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humane Nature; yet the force, vertue, and efficacy thereof did depend upon his Divine. Which is most evident by this. Suppose a man were never so innocent, never so pure, just, holy, yet a meer man,<note place="margin">Leo de pass. <hi>Serm. 12.</hi>
                     </note> who would be content to suffer all that Christ did for the ransome of mankind, could he so suffering and dying satisfie Gods wrath? could he reconcile him to all men? Surely no; it were well if he could save his own soul. What is it then that makes Christs blood of more value than his?<note place="margin">Ezek. 14.14.</note> of a greater price than that holy, just, righteous mans? Nothing but that he was not such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as Christ was; only that his blood was not the blood of the Son of God: An infinite person he was not, as Christ was, and therefore could not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for an infinite offence. It was the Son of God, and Lord of life, that dyed for us upon the Cross; but the Nature of man, and not of God, in which he dyed. But it was the Nature of God, and the infinite excellency of the same, whence the price, value, and worth of his passion grew.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Two Offices of the Priest evident it is that he executed; and in this last of Sacrifice, <hi>Aaron</hi> was a type of him. For as he offer'd the blood of beasts, so did Christ his own blood, to make satisfaction for the sinnes of the people. A third duty there is yet of the Priest behinde,<note place="margin">Gen. 14.19. Heb. 7.7.</note> and that is to <hi>Blesse,</hi> in which <hi>Melchized<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ck</hi> was a lively type of him. For he blessed <hi>Abraham.</hi> And so doth Christ as a Priest yet bless the spiritual seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and none else. The Sacrifice which he offered as an Aaronical Priest, ended with his death, and all those other sacrifices, which were but types of it. For Christ being once dead, dyes no more; he needs not;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.9. Heb. 10.26.</note> that one death was sufficient. There remaines no more sacrifice for sinne. But this other part of his Office, <hi>To bless,</hi> is perpetually to continue; whence it is written of him,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.17.</note>
                     <hi>That he was to be a Priest for ever after the order of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedech.</hi> For ever a Priest, but not after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that had its period with his Sacrifice: but after the order of <hi>Melchizedech;</hi> The chief Act of whose Priest-hood was, which we reade of, that he did blesse <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>True it is, that the Priests of <hi>Aarons</hi> order did bless too,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 23.13. Num. 6.24, 25.</note> but it was in the name of another. <hi>The Lord blesse thee; The Lord make his face to shine upon thee, &amp;c.</hi> But Christ blessed in his own Name; They by prayer

He turnes,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.9. Phil. 2.12.</note> and we must be turned.

                     <hi>His Kingdome is not of this world;</hi> It stands not in the arm or policy of man, as earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes do; But it is Spiritual, and hath its efficacy upon the hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men, in whom he rules by the power of his Spirit, and by the light of his Gospel. For this is the Sword and Scepter of his Kingdome, which he weilds in the midst of his enemies, and makes them all his footstoole:<note place="margin">Psa. 45.6. Psa. 110.1, 2.</note> Such of his enemies he converts as pertain to Gods Election; and such he conquers and confounds, as are the sonnes of perdition.

                  <p>Divers differences there are betwixt him and other Kings, betwixt his and other Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The dominions of all other Princes are limited, and the Borders of their Kingdomes bounded. But he is a Catholick King, and hath an universal Kingdome. <hi>All power is given unto him in heaven and earth.</hi> Nay,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.18. Phil. 2.9, 10. Dan. 7.14. Ephes. 1.22.</note>
                     <hi>under the earth. All people and Nations must serve him; All creatures must bow to him; for God hath put all things under his feet, being given to be the head of all things to his Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Other Princes (many of them at least) have set up their Kingdomes by the power of the Sword. A Captaine of <hi>Caesars</hi> being sent by him to the Senate for continuance of his Province, and understanding they would not grant it, claps his hand to the pummel of his Sword; Well, saith he, since you will not yield to this motion, <hi>Hic dabit,</hi> this shall force it from you: And <hi>Pompey</hi> (the <hi>Messenians</hi> alledging their Laws and Priviledges) answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in choler, What do you prattle of your Laws to us that have our Swords by our sides?

So the <hi>Assyrian, Persian, Graecian, Romane</hi> Monarchies were erected; So Tyrants and Potentates of the world end all their quarrels, and make their enemies their footstoole.</p>
                  <p>But the Scepter of Christs Kingdome is not a Sword of Steel. I know not one of his Disciples were sent forth to Preach with a Sword by his side. He subdues a people to himself <hi>non ore gladii,</hi> but <hi>gladio oris,</hi>

                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:200414:92"/>3. And this is also a third difference, <hi>that every high thought is brought to the obedience of Christ.</hi> For whereas all other Princes may by a poenal Law restraine the hand, and enforce the outward Act only; this King gives grace that reformes and amends the heart,<note place="margin">Micah 7.19.</note> by which our iniquities are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly subdued, but the vertues of faith, and hope, and charity are so powerfully infused,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.

                  <p>His Kingdome then is a Kingdome of power, by which he will destroy all his and our enemies, Sinne, Satan, Death, Hell, and all ungodly men; even them who said,<note place="margin">Luke 19.14.

                  <head>The CONCLUSION.</head>
                  <p>Whatsoever Christ did, whatsoever Christ was made, it was for us men, and our salvation. Let us then consider how nearly this benefit of unction and consecration concerns us. For as the Oyle upon <hi>Aarons</hi> head descended to the beard,<note place="margin">Psa. 133.3.</note> and reach'd to the skirts of his cloathing, so also this Oyle was poured upon Christs head, thence descended to his Members, that so he might not only be <hi>Ʋnctus,</hi> but <hi>Ʋnctor;</hi> not the Anointed only, but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointer.</p>
                  <p>It is recorded that upon the day of his birth at <hi>Rome</hi> a fountaine of Oyle broke out of the earth,<note place="margin">Oros. lib. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>20.</hi> Thom. <hi>3.</hi> part. q. <hi>36.</hi> Euseb. in Chron.</note> and continued to run that whole day. A presage this might be, that from him as a fountaine, should stream forth a holy Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from which all that belong'd to him, should receive their Unction and Appellatfon. Which of those old Kings, Priests, or Prophets, though they were stiled Christs, yet left that name to any that they saved or ruled? The Oyntment they had for themselves, not to communicate it to others. But this Name of this Christ is <hi>Oleum effusum, an Oyntment poured forth;</hi> we may be said to receive some part with him.<note place="margin">Cant. 1.3:</note> In that from this anointing we have our names; 'Tis our honour that we may be bold to proclaime <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> The medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if sad, will be very profitable; for it being once accuratly found out, what is contain'd in this Name, we must needs be much quickned to a vertuous life. For as he who affects to be honoured with the Title of a Physician, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour, or Mathematician, will endeavour by all meanes to give sufficient Testimony that he is worthy of that name: In like manner they who intend to glory in the name of a Christian, will labour to live as a Christian ought,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:200414:92"/> that so their works may adorn their profession,<note place="margin">Titus 2.10. 1 Cor. 14.25.</note> and force even those who are without, to confess that Christ is in them indeed.</p>
                  <p>A Christian is a name of vertue, of justice, of goodness, of integrity, of patience, of chastity, of prudence, of humility, of courtesie, of innocence, of piety. In a word, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an imitation of the divine Nature. Neither doth this definition pass the bounds of reason. For since man at first was created after the Image of God; which being lost, our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian profession aimes to restore; it cannot then be otherwise,<note place="margin">Psalm 1.1. Psalm 119.1, 3. 1 Pet. 2.1.</note> but Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty must be an imitation of the Divine Nature. A Christian then is he who imitates Christ, who is holy, innocent, undefiled; in whose breast there is no malicious wickedness, in whose tongue there is no guile, who undoes no man, but helps all.</p>
                  <p>But and if in the profession of Christianity a man live the life of a Jew, and fall below the Heathen; if he take delight in mischief,<note place="margin">Psalm 36.4. Psalm 94.20. Luke 18.2.</note> plot and practice it; if he feare not God, nor reverence man; if he give himself over to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness, to adultery, to fornication, to drunkenness; if he harbour hatred, strife, wrath, variance, or cruelty,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccles. 10.1.</hi> Vid. Nyssen. loc. cit.</note> he is but a dead fly that corrupts the sweet Oyntment of Christs Name; or the Ape dress'd up, and dancing hansomely in the attire of a Boy, that discover'd himself upon the casting down of the Almonds.</p>
                  <p>Should some skilfull Painter undertake to present you with the lively por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of some great and good Prince, and instead thereof set him out with the head of a Lyon, the paw of a Beare, the teeth of a Dog, and the taile of a Fox, would not he that expected some excellent piece, and the Prince who by this deformed Image is so abused, conceive an intolerable injury and scorne put upon him? The case is not altogether unlike; every Christian by profession makes you believe that he will present you with an exact express of Christ, with a draught of his humility, his meekness, his patience, his innocency, his sincerity, indeed that very Image of righteousness and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in which he was created; but upon the view you finde the cruelty of a Lion, the mercy of a Bear, the raven of a Dog, the craft of a Fox, and must not this needs provoke him to anger whose picture you have undertaken to represent,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.14. Isa. 52.5. Rom. 2.24.</note> yet have so falsified? Will not this <hi>give occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For in what draught the image is represented, such an enemy will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Prototype to be. If then Christianity be the imitation of Christ, he that shall behold in our lives expressions of all goodnesse, will easily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that Christ is a good Master, and the God whom we honour, a just and a holy God. But and if the man who gives out that he is his Image, be deformed with passions, and mis-shaped with beastly vices, advantage will be taken by an ill minde to cast an aspersion upon that God whose Name we bear, as if he were the same with his servants.</p>

                  <p>I might farther set off these perswasions, and improve them to such a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, that every one must confesse, they must be done, or else for ever disclaime the name of Christian. Since to be wise in the wayes of salvation, to mortifie all carnality, to conquer their trayterous wills, and rebellious affections, is as proper to this profession, as light is to the Sun, heat to the fire. But I have ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you, and therefore in a word, I shall labour to melt, and charme, and win you into so necessary, so feizable, so gainful a service.

               <p>Good God, how much the Spirit of God is pleased with this allusion! It is press'd in the Old, it is opened in the New Testament; In both we finde, that God also hath his Espousals. The first marriage that ever was betwixt our great-great Grandsier <hi>Adam,</hi> and our mother <hi>Eve,</hi> is applyed to this mystical mariage by Saint <hi>Paul;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.23. Verse 31. John 3.29.</note> so that though we have no warrant to make it a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, yet authority enough we have to make it a Mystery, in which the Church is Gods Spouse, Christ the Husband, the Prophets and Apostles <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, friends of the Bridegroome to bring them together.</p>
               <p>Now among this Reverend and Holy Order, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> steps forth,<note place="margin">Beza in loc.</note>
                  <hi>Loqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ut procus &amp; ambit, non autem sibi, sed Christo.</hi> He speaks as a Suiter, and wooes, but not for himself, it is for Christ: Being ready to do that at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> what they, who succeed these twelve Patriarchs in the Pastoral charge, must do to their flock. He, and they to be Suiters, labour to espouse, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent souls as pure Virgins to Christ.</p>
               <p>Three persons take up the whole Text, as many as are absolutely necessary at every wedding. <hi>Ego, Vos, Christo.</hi> The Apostle, as the Priest. Christ the Bridegroom. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> in place of the Bride. The whole runs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Relatives. Here then we are to consider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Relation that <hi>Ego</hi> hath to <hi>Vos,</hi> in what relation Saint <hi>Paul</hi> stands to the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> if he were not an Apostle to others,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.2.</note> yet he was to them, for they were the seale of his Apostleship in the Lord. This then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates a reciprocal office, a Duty of care in him, and a return of willingnesse in them. He to espouse; they to be espoused; without which ordinarily this match cannot well proceed:</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next Relation to be though on is, how <hi>Vos</hi> stands to <hi>Christo.</hi> The <hi>Corinthians</hi> and all the faithful to Christ; As men they relate to their Maker, but as Christians to their Redeemer. Either then be content to be espoused, and keep you fast to him, or expect no Redemption.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:200414:94"/>3. Upon just reason I hope you will be perswaded to it; and in the <hi>Relato,</hi> which is Christ, you have reason upon reason, even a threefold cord. He to whom you are to joyne, is, <hi>Ʋnus, Vir, Christus.</hi> One, a Husband, Christ; by his Unity, his Manhood, his Unction, he will be helpful to you. For these causes also, keep you only to him. Now these three shall be the motives by which I will promote the suit:</p>
               <p n="4">4. To which, if you mean to yield, know that you are the <hi>Correlatum,</hi> the Spouse; and then your qualifications must be such as are required in every honest Bride; you must be a chast Virgin; Virginity and Chastity, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the other after, being the conditions that every one expects that marries a Maid.<note place="margin">Eccles. 12.13.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. In brief, will you heare the Conclusion of the whole matter? The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end that the Apostle was call'd, that I, or any Priest took Orders, is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here endeavours, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to fit, and so represent to Christ. I will make it my last point, and conclude with it, labouring to make the knot firm, to joyn you to Christ, and Christ to you.</p>

Now the stile of this Text runnes under this last, where we have a couple to be joyn'd, and a Minister to joyn them: Who had endeavoured to do his Office, and therefore he speaks in some passion, <hi>I am jealous of you;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 2.</note> This being the speech of <hi>Paul</hi> the zealot.

                  <p>All which have their rise and fall from jealousie.

For what man, even the veryest Pagan and Infidel, hath not a Relation to Christ in this sence! who is not man as he is? A nearer coherence then there must be than that of Nature. For the Church doth partake of Christ, as <hi>Eve</hi> did of <hi>Adam.</hi> Now God made <hi>Eve</hi> of the Rib of <hi>Adam;</hi> and his Church he hath built out of the very flesh, and bleeding side of the Sonne of God. That is as it were <hi>principium passivum,</hi> the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial part; and this he doth actuate, enlive, and move by his own Spirit, which is <hi>principium activum,</hi> and the formal part, that truly <hi>dat nomen &amp; esse,</hi> gives it its name, and makes it what it is. He took our pawn, and he gave us his; he took unto him our flesh the pawne from us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.22. &amp; cap. 5.5.</note> and he gave unto us his Spirit the Pawne from Him, upon that day that he made us His.</p>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:200414:96"/> know that we are Christians, that we are in heart Christians, as <hi>Julians</hi> soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers proclaimed to his teeth. And what service and duty this Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth upon us, you have heard in the former Sermon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But Titles are but blasts of aire, with realities they beget respect. You shall now see then, what a Dowry this husband upon the match conveys over to keep up his Spouses honour. As the husband endows his wife with his worldly goods, so he makes over to his Spouse his spiritual Graces, and gives her a right to partake in what is his; <hi>Communio bonorum intercedit conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, ita donis suis Deus cumulat fideles.</hi> His presence he vouchsafes her, and with that himself, and what is his, partly by imputation, and partly by real infusion.</p>
                  <p>First, a good husband hides the weaknesses and infirmities of his wife, and this man doth it to his Spouse. He imputes to her his whole innocent life, and casting his skirt over her,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.8. Rev. 7.13, 14.</note> covers her all, <hi>veste talari,</hi> with his long white robe; long enough to cover all, and white enough to beautifie all, so that God cannot see iniquity in <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 23.21.</note>
                     <hi>Aethiopissa haec,</hi> black of her self, and moorish in her complexion, yet betroth'd to him in loving kindnesse and mercy,<note place="margin">Isa. 61.10.</note> becomes faire, and draws Gods eye to her. These are the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of salvation in which she is cloathed, these the robe of righteousnesse in which she is covered; as a bridegroome decketh himself with his orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.27.</note> and as a bride adorneth her self with her jewels. In these he atires her, that he might present her unto himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.</p>
                  <p>Again, a husband must answer for his wife, for she is under covert-barn; and in Law there lies no Action against the wife, during the husbands life. This trouble also he put himself to, to answer for his Spouse. Trouble, did I say? my, pain and shame, and sorrow and death. This was his passive obedience, and he imputes this, and by it frees his Church from all forfeitures and penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatsoever. This is a comfortable point. For if the devil at any time enter his Action, and sue you for breach of Covenant; your answer may be, that the flesh and you are divorced, that you have made choice of another husband, <hi>virum Christum,</hi> the man Christ, who, as your Head, hath taken upon him to pay your debts; and therefore if the Plaintiff will reply and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, let him sue him. And this is the first part of the Dowry, a discharge of the bond, and a discharge of the penalty; the one by his unspotted life, the other by his undeserved death, or rather both by both. So that nor debt, nor penalty, nor the breach of the directive, nor penal part of the obligation can light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Spouse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, but beside this imputed justice, it pleaseth him to adorne his Spouse with a world of graces. And in this he exceeds all other husbands. If they finde fair wives, well, but they make them not. No man can make a black face white,<note place="margin">Cant. 1.5.</note> a deformed comely; and all the Art us'd to do it, doth at last marre and wither it. But Christ comes to his Spouse, by nature deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in visage black, puts his beauty upon her, and with his gifts and graces makes her comely. He makes her wise with the one, and vertuous with the other:<note place="margin">Psal. 45.11, 13.</note>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by his graces and gifts <hi>the Kings daughter is all glorious within,</hi> and the King hath pleasure in her beauty.</p>
                  <p>More plainly, sanctification and holinesse of life, a vertuous and godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, the duties of piety and charity, are a good part of this dowry, to which he hath entituled every soul that shall be his Spouse. You were, saith the Apostle to these <hi>Corinthians, you were,</hi> before this marriage, <hi>fornicators, idolaters,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11.</note>

                  <p>Thirdly, for upon the marriage the Church brings forth children to God.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.9. Rom. 8.16. and 9.26. Joh. 1.13. Gen. 30.1. Isa. 54.1.</note> No more then to the world, and the flesh. A main end of Wedlock, this.

                  <p>But, <hi>unde hoc vobis?</hi> How came all this to passe, that he should thus affect,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.5. Jam. 1.18.</note> thus honour and advance his Spouse? That he did thus affect, it was his meere good will; but that he might thus endow, we are beholding to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus;</hi> for nothing could he have done this way, had he not beene Christ.</p>
                  <p>Conceive it thus. The aptitude or faculty to match arose from his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and his Office; and by vertue of the anointing, he became such a person, and was capable of such a place.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he was anointed, demonstrated that he was man, and this was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, or else no matching; for all Matrimonial contracts must be betwixt those of the same kinde. A promise there was for this match many yeares before; but the solemnization of it was upon that day he took flesh, to which you are call'd in the <hi>Canticles. Go forth, O daughters of</hi> Zion,<note place="margin">Cant. 3.11. Isa. 9.6.</note>
                     <hi>and behold King</hi> Solomon, that is <hi>Shar-solom,</hi> this Prince of peace, with his Crown wherewith his mother crowned him, <hi>i. e.</hi> that flesh which he assumed from his mother, the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in the day of his espousals.</p>
                  <p>The foundation then of this matrimonial union is in the flesh of Christ. A faithful man is first united to the humane nature, and afterwards by help of the humanity, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to the word, or divine nature. For though ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of salvation and life depends on the fulnesse of the Godhead of Christ, yet it is communicated to us by his flesh. For we can apprehend and elect, but as we know; but by the humanity we first come to the knowledge of Christ as a Mediatour, and therefore in the order and nature of faith, his flesh is the first thing we can reflect on, to which in our thoughts we joyne.</p>
                  <p>Thus God propos'd him to us, <hi>The seed of the woman.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.15. Deut. 18.18.</note> Thus <hi>Moses</hi> foretold him, <hi>A Prophet of your brethren like unto me.</hi> Thus the Prophets made mention of him; <hi>To you a Son is born, to you a child is given.</hi> Every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>the seed, the Son of</hi> David, <hi>the root of</hi> Jesse. Saint <hi>John</hi> confesseth,<note place="margin">Isa. 9.6.11.1.10. Joh. 1.14. 1 Joh. 1.1.</note>
                     <hi>That they saw his glory, as of the onely begotten Son of God;</hi> but before he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, <hi>that he took flesh, and dwelt in us: That he was the word of life,</hi> but such, <hi>that they saw it, and handled it.</hi> First they knew him to be man, then God.</p>
                  <p>His Deity no question is the fountain, from whence doth arise all our good, life, salvation, &amp;c. but his flesh and humanity, is as it were the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, by which all these graces are derived to us. If then we know not the channel, by which these Graces are conveyed, we may thirst for ever. And the way to know this conduit-pipe, is to go along with God, and search for it as he hath propos'd, promis'd and reveal'd it unto us; that is, to begin at the seed of the woman, and thence ascend to his eternal generation; else Christ can be no Saviour, no Mediator, no Husband unto us.</p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:200414:97"/>
                  <p>Farther, in the Sacraments, as in two chrystal glasses, this doctrine is most apparent. Two parts there are of every Sacrament; the visible signe, and the invisible grace, <hi>res terrena, &amp; coelestis.</hi> A faithful soul comes preparedly, and takes a share of both. But in what order? is it not in that, as they are proposed by God? First the visible, put case the water, the bread and wine: Then remission of sinne, and all Christ: As by this Divine dispensation, the material part is received first, and after in that, and by that the spiritual: So also in this case, you must reflect upon Christ as a perfect man, and in that nature, and be conjoyn'd to him, before you can be partaker, or have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny benefit from the Divine. And therefore the Apostles endeavour is to joyne you here to one husband, which is Christ the Messiah, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, that is, to the Man Christ, as well knowing that God is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of unction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And this anointing fitted him for this Office, to be a King, and a Priest, and Prophet to his Church, and to make us Kings and Priests to God. For though he was anointed <hi>prae consortibus, farre above his fellows,</hi> yet it was <hi>pro consortibus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 45.7. Eph. 5.25, 26.</note> for his consorts sake. He needed none of this sweet oyle for himself. But she, his Spouse, was in great want of it, and for her sake he would be <hi>Christus,</hi> the Messiah.</p>
                  <p>For had he not been united to our Nature, which is that grace of union; and had he not sanctified this our Nature,<note place="margin">Verse 27.</note> which is the grace of unction; there had been no Church to bear his Name; there had been no obedience, either active or passive, to be imputed to us; there had been no Gifts, no Graces sent down upon men: In one word, no Christian society to bring forth children to God.</p>
                  <p>All this while, as I conceive, there hath been nothing, but that you have been well enough content to hear. For the beauty of a bridegroom is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,<note place="margin">Psal. 19.5.</note> and draws eyes after him. And if ever any, then he who is <hi>unus, vir Christus.</hi>

                  <p>This is pain and grief to me. Yet thus much I dare say of those ancient Professors of Christianity; They thought that <hi>nulla parte decuit maechari vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem,</hi> that a Virgin should not be unchast in any part, <hi>non lingua, non au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, non oculo, non vultu, non nictu, non nutu.</hi> Not in tongue, not by the ear, not by the eye, not by a look, a wink, a nod; whereas we set the door o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to blasphemous words, and the windows to lascivious objects, we admit the devil to parle as <hi>Eve</hi> did,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> and drink in his suggestions. And that after all this we set the hand to work is too apparent.</p>
                  <p>And are we not chast Virgins in the mean time, that have neither <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentes oculos,</hi> nor <hi>continentes manus,</hi> nor abstemious eyes, nor hands.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:200414:98"/> and the common Maxime must not be despised, <hi>That a good conscience and good manners must go together.</hi> Our Religion is ancient, and therefore it must be attired like a grave and ancient matron, in a civil, vertuous, sober, decent, modest and comely manner. The new fashions of these times neither for faith, nor manners become it; not the first, for it forceth her Virginity; nor the last, for it wrongs her chastity.

Since therefore now we have both by his <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> granted unto us, let us do that for which we are met: I to declare, you to hear of his Nativity. Your task is the easier; for he can do little, that cannot lend an eare; mine the harder, for <hi>Quis declarabit?</hi> saith our Prophet, evident it is there is difficulty in it.</p>
               <p>Other Offices of our Saviours Mediatorship were more easily expressed, more easily conceived; our Eloquent Prophet, like some cunning Artist (as if he would make this his Masterpiece) hath here shew'd his skill,<note place="margin">Vetse 3, 4, 5.</note> and drawn his abasements and sufferings to the life. The sorrow and grief in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, the unfriendly wounds in his hands and side, the blows and bruises on his face, the chastisements and stripes on his back, his oppression and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction at his Arraignment, and his Lamb-like silence at his slaughter;<note place="margin">7, 6.</note> Not so much as the course dealing of his own Nation toward him is omitted; nor the small pity they had of a man, when they should see him in this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble case. <hi>They rejected him, they despised him, they esteemed him not.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> In the expression of all these severals the Prophet hath gone beyond himself; and in admiration only demands, as well he might, <hi>Quis crederet?</hi> who would ever believe that the Saviour of the World should be thus coursely and rudely handled?<note place="margin">1.</note>

For had our Saviour been borne only after the ordinary and natural generation of men, it had been no easie matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how in the womb those elements of being do unite, and mingle,<note place="margin">Job 10.8, 9, 10.11,</note> and curdle together: how these three noble and heroick parts, the Liver, Heart, and Braine linked together by slender strings, do in time fill with flesh: Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how every portion of the whole body being, as I may so say, entuned to other, stretch'd out by sinews, and strengthened with bones, were at last cloathed with skinne, and after some few months sent with teares to draw in the common aire. Had, I say, our Saviours birth been after the usual manner of men, it might well be the Subject of our admiration:<note place="margin">Psal. 139.13, 14.</note>
                  <hi>David</hi> was amazed when he search'd into it, <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made, &amp;c.</hi> And well he might; for even the Mother her self, in the shop, as I may so say, of whose womb this strange work is wrought, is utterly unacquainted with the Creatours skill, by which the frame is perfected: Witness that Religious Mother encouraging her seven sonnes to dye for the Laws of their Fathers; <hi>I cannot tell,</hi> saith she, <hi>how ye came into my womb, for I neither gave you breath nor life; it is not I that set in order the members of your body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Mac. 7.22.</note> but doubtless the Creatour of the world, who formed the birth of man. Had it been then no more but this, <hi>Quis declarabit,</hi> what tongue were able to declare it? what pen fully to express it?</p>
               <p>But there is more in it than so. For as there was never such a man, so there never was such a birth in which God was the Father, a Virgin the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Holy Ghost the workmaster; by which to speak in <hi>Nazianzens</hi> Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And how difficult it is to declare all this, and make it fully intelligible, were there no other reason to perswade it, yet this one were sufficient; that Learned men, and those of the sharpest wits, while they endeavour'd to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to others their conceits about it, have split upon so many Rocks, and pester'd the Church with so many Heresies.

Which because in this point it hath happened to many subtile heads, and that especially in the first times, when they were neare the best guides, we must needs conclude that the Declaration of this mystery is not so easie as most men conceive, and perswade men rather readily to belive it, than search over curiously into it.</p>

Sixteen years after <hi>Nestorius</hi> arose <hi>Eutyches,</hi> who held the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Nestorius</hi> unreasonable, and therefore he confessed that there were in Christ two natures, the divine and humane; but that these were chang'd, confused, and mixt together after his incarnation; of which there resulted but one nature, to wit, the divine.

               <p>For first it drew after it the heresie of the <hi>Theopaschites,</hi> or of the the passible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Deity,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Brerwood</hi> of Relig. lang. c. 25. de Macon.</note> because the Deity of Christ was become (in their conceit) the same nature with the humanity, which was passible.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, when the fondness of both these were discovered, a new device arose, namely, that there was but one nature in our Saviour, but not by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion or confusion of substances, as <hi>Eutyches</hi> taught, but only by compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The Deity and humanity becoming one nature by coalition, as the body and soule into one nature in man.

               <p>Lastly, this errour being exploded as a meer fancy, there succeeded that of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> who confessing two Natures to be in Christ, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that there was but one Will, and one Action of both natures in the Person of our Saviour. If you shall now ask, how it came to pass that so many great Wits ran so many wild-goose chases about this Article? the answer is obvious, that it proceeded from the depth of this mystery, which while they went about to sound with the short line and plummet of humane Reason, they fouly err'd from the truth. Whereas had they soberly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themselves with what is revealed of it, they had seen enough to guide their feet in the way of peace,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.79.</note> and not perhaps have let in the <hi>Sarracens</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> among them, who have been ever since to them the scourge of God, for that dishonour they brought upon his Sonne.</p>

                  </gap>, he emptied himself of it, the glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of the Deity being vayled with flesh.

               <p>When I had proceeded thus farre, I thought that I had made a sufficient Declaration of this grand mystery: But taking a second view, I found that all this while I was upon the destructive part, and had only declared and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed what Hereticks had imagin'd about it. Besides, I saw that most of these Adverbs were either Negative or Privative. And negations and privations, teach no more than what the thing is not; they informe not what it is. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary then I thought it, to take another course; to try whether there might not be a farther disquisition made, by which the truth, to be holden about this secret, might in some sort be declared.</p>
               <p>And an easier way, and clearer, I thought could not be found, than the Creed hath directed in two words, <hi>Conceived,</hi> and <hi>Borne;</hi> for if the riches of those notions were fully discover'd, the truth necessary to belief, would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily appear. In the first we have to consider his <hi>Conception;</hi> the last points us to his <hi>Incarnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his <hi>Conception</hi> we are to reflect upon two things especially.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The framing of the manhood, <hi>Conceiv'd.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The Sanctifying of it, <hi>By the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>In his <hi>Incarnation</hi> we will open these two points.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The personal union of the manhood with the Godhead,</item>
                  <item>2. The glorious effects which proceed from so glorious an union with the Deity.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, For the framing of his manhood we have the matter of it, and the manner of it expressed in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The matter of his body was the flesh and blood of the blessed Virgin; flesh immediately he took from her seed, which yet was the seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> derived by succession to <hi>Abraham,</hi> propagated to <hi>David,</hi> and so onward till it came to <hi>Mary,</hi> that so he might be the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Son of <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 3. Gen. 3.15. &amp; 22.18. Psal. 132.11.</note> as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> deduceth his Genealogy. In a word, he was <hi>the seed of the woman</hi> who was <hi>to break the Serpents head; that seed in which all the Nations of the earth should be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;</hi> that seed of whom God said to <hi>David, Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy seat;</hi> and this is one reason that the Evangelist ends not his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy till he comes to <hi>Adam.</hi> And yet there is another, that we might know that he was to purge, expiate, and save <hi>Adams</hi> flesh; that is, <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his race from the guilt and punishment of sin due to him and them, for his and their disobedience, of which his was the first Original: whence St.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.17.</note>
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> when he shew'd by whom sinne came into the world, and polluted all men, <hi>viz. The first Adam;</hi> immediately declares who it was that took it away, and saved men from it, <hi>viz. Adams,</hi> or the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins seed, <hi>The Second Adam.</hi> The matter then of his Body is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:200414:103"/>2. As for the manner how this Virgins seed should be framed into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a man, in is miraculous. The God of Nature chang'd here the course of Nature, and above Nature, without the help of man, by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary operation of the holy Ghost, made the Word to become flesh. Two actions are ascribed by the Angel to the holy Ghost in this great work;<note place="margin">Luke 1.35.</note> the one to come upon the Virgin; the other to overshadow her. By the first was signified his extraordinary power in making a Virgin remaining a Virgin to conceive a Son: Which was done at that instant, when the blessed Virgin broke out into these words, <hi>Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it to me according to thy word;</hi> for here was no need of any delay, since this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was the sole work of God, without the help of man. Her consent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was expected; and that being given by <hi>Ecce ancilla Domini,</hi> the <hi>fiat</hi> instantly followed; as soon as when upon his <hi>fiat</hi> the heaven and earth were created. Presently she conceiv'd a Son.</p>
               <p>The encrease and growth of his body to a just quantity, was not in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, but was by degrees brought to it in about nine months time. But the formation of his body was perfected and shaped at that instant; flesh he then took,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Damasc.</hi> lib. 3. c. 2. <hi>Zanch.</hi> de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnat lib. 2. q 7, 8. Thes. 1.</note>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that was animated with a reasonable and understanding soule. Or which we are able to give these reasons. First, Because the power of the Agent was infinite, and therefore he was able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay to perfect the conception out of the matter before prepared. Secondly, Because that which was conceiv'd was <hi>Homo,</hi> a man; but a whole man is not a body alone, or a soul alone, but a substance composed of both. And therefore it was necessary, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Word should take a body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with a reasonable soul: for otherwise there would be some moment of time, in which the Son of God should not be true man, but only a body the material part of man. Thirdly, This body so informed, was perfect in all parts and Organs; a soul it had, as is but now proved, and then the body must be perfect, for the soul is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that which moves an Organical body. And it no way became the Son of God, who is the fountaine of all perfections, to assume into the unity of his person, an unshaped or imperfect thing, such as that of an <hi>Embria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The other action of the holy Ghost, was <hi>Overshadowing,</hi> which checks all curiosity, and commands us not to be bold to search into that work too farre, over which the Holy Ghost hath cast a shadow: <hi>Doceri non potest nisi à donante,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bern.</hi> Hom. 4. super Missus est.</note>
                  <hi>nec disci nisi à formante,</hi> to alter <hi>Bernards</hi> words a little.</p>
               <p>O God, why should men go about to seek for a cleare light, where thou hast cast a shadow! why to look upon that Sun, betwixt which and us thou hast interposed a Cloud? No Mother knows the manner of her natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; what presumption then is it for flesh and blood to be inquisitive how the holy Ghost did his work in the dark womb of the Virgin? As therefore after the Angels salutation and solution, this blessed mother makes no more doubts, nor raises no more questions about the manner; for her <hi>How shall this thing be?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 1.18.</note> went before; So also when the Scripture hath taught us, that the Birth of Christ was on this wise, let us ask no more questions, but in an holy admiration break out with Saint <hi>Paul, Great is the mystery of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Christ revealed in the flesh!</hi> for if we should, I know not how we should be satisfied;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> for <hi>Quis Declararet? Who shall declare it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The manner of it I mean. For as for the second point, and the effects thence proceeding, they may be declared.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first of which is negative; that though he took upon him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Luke 1.35.</note> a body of weakness, yet he took not to him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a body of sinne. For he was Sanctified from the womb; <hi>That which is born of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:200414:103"/> shall be called holy;</hi> not holy flesh, not a holy man, nor a holy infant, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Singulariter Sanctum,</hi> by some prerogative.</p>
               <p>He was no more polluted by the contagion of our depraved nature, than fire is changed, being receiv'd in the pores of some piece of rusty Iron, whose force is no whit dulled by the rust, coldness, or soyle of that heavy body.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Basil.</hi> Hom. 25.</note> For by the power of the Holy Ghost, there was a stoppage made of that Original corruption which doth flow into the nature of all mankind,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.9.</note> and as a little le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, doth soure the whole lump.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But secondly, Negative holiness there was not in him alone, but Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive also; even an infusion of all holiness and purity in the manhood of Christ, being the endowment of the soule and body with all manner of graces and vertues proportionable to his own purposes, intents, and counsels.</p>
               <p>And this is the grace of Divine Unction, which Divines willingly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the body and soul of this Messiah: For we may not think, that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of our Saviour by this conception, receiv'd no vertue or quality above nature. But even as the Sword that is made fiery, doth not only cut by the sharpness which it hath from its own edge, but also burns by that glowing heat which it received and retaines from the fire: So also the humanity of our Saviour is enabled by the Deity that assumed it with many more graces than it naturally had. The Godhead imparting unto it so many perfections, as either it was being a creature capable of, or the exigence of that oeconomy, <hi>viz.</hi> mans Redemption did require.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>John</hi> shews us plainly, that the Word which dwelt among us,<note place="margin">John 1.14.</note> was full of grace and truth. For the illustration of which, the Schoolmen do thus distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of grace and the fulness of it.</p>
               <p>First, Say they, there is <hi>plenitud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> excellentiae,</hi> a fulness of excellency;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Viguer.</hi> instit.</note> such as is that of some maine pipe, by which the Virgin-water of the fountain is conveyed into the lesser Cisterns. And such a plenty of grace they place in the blessed Virgin, who was indeed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, highly graced,<note place="margin">Luke 1.28.</note> highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, to be made the Mother of our Lord; in reference to which we may say truly, <hi>Nil gratiae ad nos venit, nisi quod non prius per uterum Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae transit,</hi> No grace came to us, but first past through the Virgins womb.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is <hi>plenitudo abundantiae,</hi> abundant grace; such was the grace which was in the Apostles, who were all fill'd with the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Acts 2.4.</note>
                  <hi>ad mensuram vasculi,</hi> as full as a Vessel could hold; being those greater Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterns, that first held, and then let out the water of life which yet refresheth our thirsty souls; and these are commonly call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>gratiae gratis da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae,</hi> Gifts freely given by God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is <hi>plenitudo sufficientiae,</hi> as much grace as is sufficient to save a soul, and keep it from sin, which is commonly call'd <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>gratia gratum faciens,</hi> that grace which makes a man acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable in the eyes of God, renews, comforts, upholds a sinner from falling and fainting. And to that soul which hungers and thirsts after it, is return'd that answer which was given to Saint <hi>Paul, Sufficit tibi gratia mea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.9. Eph. 4.7.</note>
                  <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee;</hi> for to every one is given some, more or less, as their wants are more or less in their Pilgrimage toward the Celestial <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, But the last is <hi>Gratia effluentiae,</hi> overflowing grace, or the grace of the fountaine, from which Cistern, Pipe and Pitchers are fill'd. It is sweet in it self, pure in it self, sufficient of it self; from which all sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, all pureness, all excellency, all abundance, all sufficiency is. And this alone we confess to be in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who was
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:200414:104"/> sanctified in his mothers womb, by the Holy Ghost the fountain of all Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; both by the extirpation of Original corruption, and infusion of grace and holiness.</p>

                  <p>Hitherto have I gone about to declare that, which in declaring I admire, and in admiring reverence, and in reverence do admire again, and in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility ever shall, why the second Person in the Trinity would have a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to declare; why he should become bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh; be sanctified in the womb, be united to our nature, and cloathed with our skin.</p>
                  <p>But if God would come down to us in the likeness of men, why did he not appear like himself? why not as sometimes he did upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a pavilion of thick Clouds,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.16.</note> usher'd with the blast of some Angels Trump, speaking in Thunder, and lighted down with some flash of lightning from heaven? This had been for the Majesty of a God, fit for the glory of so great a King.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but he came not now in Majesty; he came in great humility to visit us, in love to Redeem us, and therefore he hath not now so much as a still and soft voice to affright us.<note place="margin">

That we should not flee at this his visitation, <hi>Ecce infans &amp; sine voce,</hi> Behold an infant, and without a voice; voice he hath none, except it be <hi>vagire in cunis,</hi> to cry for us, not a word to speak in an angry tone.</p>
                  <p>In nature, creatures of like kind are commonly well-affected to other; that then we might know how he stood affected to us, he came in our own likeness, an infant of a span long, born of a woman, wrapped up in swadling cloaths; and except it were that his mother wanted a Chamber to lie in in the Inn, and a Cradle to rock him, for which she was glad to make use of the Manger, like he was to us in all things.</p>

                  <p>I bid you not to imitate the Heathen in their excesses and riot, but in their joy, in their thankfulness; not for the birth of some temporal Benefactor, but for the Nativity of Jesus Christ the Son of God.

Joy there was on earth; for then the fields were the Temple, the Shepherds the Auditory, an Angel the Chantour, Angels the Quire; the <hi>Ʋersiculus, Behold I bring you tydings of great joy;</hi>

Behold I once more present you with my Jesus, and once more with salvation: And if Jesus the person, and if Salvation the favour be not glad and welcome tidings to you, I know not how to choose a Text. Brethren, as sometimes Saint <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Philippians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.1.</note>
                  <hi>To write the same things to you, to me is not grievous, but to you safe:</hi> So say I, To preach the same things unto you, I shall not think it troublesome, when it may concern your profit and your safety.</p>
               <p>Before, you have heard the earnest desire of the old Church, That God would make good his promise for the Redemption of the world: That the Patriarchs and Prophets desired to see that day. Heard you have also of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Generation, and of that in time, that he was from everlasting the Son of God; and that he was borne in the fulness of time the Son of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and as such the Messiah, anointed to be King, Priest, and Prophet to his Church. It remaines only, that I acquaint you how he became under the Law; for till that be done, we cannot have any solid comfort from him. 'Tis not the unity of his Nature that can sufficiently secure us; for so he is united to all mankind. There must be an unity of person also, which only can be beneficial to us. And so it was upon this day of his Circumcision; then he personally became our Surety, submitted himself to the Law, undertook for us to pay both debt and penalty, and so was in as deep as we were, since in Law the Debtor and Surety make but one person. Now this is the day when he went under the Knife, engaged himself for our Debt, and had the Name above every Name, that Name <hi>Jesus</hi> imposed upon Him.</p>
               <p>In this Gospel there be very many memorable things, all worthy of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious consideration. First an Army of Angels that sung the Antheme. Then the diligence of the Shepherds in seeking, their gratitude in praising God. Lastly, the carefulness of <hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin; who as a Mother, kept him in her armes; as an hand-maid kept him in her lowly heart.</p>
               <p>But at this time I pass by these, and will insist upon these three particulars clearly set forth in this verse.</p>

                  <p>I presume I shall not need to Catechise you about the Sacrament of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision; when, why, and to whom given;<note place="margin">Gen. 17.10, 11 &amp;c.</note> as that it was the first Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the old Law: that it was instituted by God: that given to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a signe, a seale. A signe, that whatsoever is begotten and proceedeth of the seed of man, is originally corrupt and sinful. And a Seale also, that as the <hi>praepu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Yea, and a farther assurance, that now God and man were entred into a closer and nearer Covenant; He to be their God, and they his people; He to bless them, they to serve him.</p>
                  <p>But what do you now circumcising this Child? that all other children, nay men, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all be circumcised, there is great reason; but why this Child? <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> are subject to many foolish and noysome lusts; which of the Saints did you ever yet reade of,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.9.</note> who in something was no sinner?<note place="margin">Isa. 64.6.

Necessary then it is, that not <hi>faex populi,</hi> the dregs the worst, but <hi>flos populi,</hi> the flowre, the best of the people be cut. And this reason is binding for Infants also; for being conceiv'd of unclean seed,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.5. Ez. 16.3, 4, 5.</note> and warm'd in a sinful womb, at their birth polluted no less in sin than in blood, they also must go under the Knife.</p>
                  <p>But what do you now Circumcising him in whom there was nothing su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous? how comes this about? Go and circumcise your own corrupt and sinful flesh; never make him bleed for it, <hi>qui nec peccatum admisit,</hi>

                     </gap>cted none is manifest; for which way should he contract any, who had God for his Father, a Virgin for his Mother, whose womb was sanctified by the Holy Ghost? He did, he knew no sin; why then must he as other infants undergo this pain?</p>
                  <p>There was no absolute necessity in it, that's certain; but yet very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. Since it pleased him to be the Saviour of the world, convenient it was to take those wayes as he judg'd most fit to save.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It became him to be obedient who would be a Saviour; for how should a disobedient person satisfie for our disobedience? How should he pay for the breach of the Law, that would not himself keep the Law?<note place="margin">Gen. 17.12, 14</note> Now a Law there was, <hi>That every male which was eight dayes old, must be circumcised, or else be cut off from Gods people.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> That then he might make it evident that he was now, as other, under the Law, and bound no less than any other to obey, content he was to bleed as other Males.<note place="margin">Mat. 23.23.</note> We make light of all Gods Commands, be they the greater matters of the Law, judgement, and mercy; or be they the less, Mint, Annice, Cummin, all's one with us, for we break all. And if we be scrupulous in any, it is about the Mint, and Annice; to disobey in judgement and justice we stick but little: Whereas our Saviour would be subject even to a Ceremony; rather smart, than have one Title of the Law not fulfilled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This first; the next might be to set us an example of great humility,<note place="margin">Luke 18.11.</note> that we be not spiritually proud, that we set not up our wheele with the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee,</hi> and boast we are not like other men, not as the <hi>Publican,</hi> when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we are farre worse. This did not he,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.7. Isa. 53.12.</note> who made himself of no reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who was content to be numbred among sinners, and take upon him the mark and note of sinners, and to beare it about him all his life long: Though
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:200414:107"/> he had not so much as the least impurity of a wound, yet he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to carry in his flesh the scarres and Ligatures of a wounded man. Which of us, were he conscious to himself, I say not of so much glory, but so much innocency, would willingly be put to paine and shame, and receive into his body the brand of a Malefactour?<note place="margin">Jer 6.15. 1 Pet. 1.19.</note> We sinne and blush not; nay, we sinne, and take it ill to be esteemed sinners: But so great was his humility, though a Lamb without spot, yet <hi>non dedignatus,</hi> thought it no dishonour to be numbred among the transgressors.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Farther, the vaine assertions of many Hereticks are silenc'd by this one Act;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epiphan.</hi> lib. 1. Tom. 2.</note> and hence <hi>Epiphanius</hi> fetcheth Arguments to confute three grand He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies. <hi>Manes</hi> held Christ had no true body; as if his being made flesh, had been only a mockery. <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> that his flesh was consubstantial with the Deity. <hi>Ʋalentinus,</hi> that it was celestial and spiritual.</p>
                  <p>But how fond these fancies are, the blood of this his Circumcision evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth; for had he not been truly made flesh, he could not bleed; had the substance of his body naturally been, or else by conversion turn'd into his Deity, there had not been any thing superfluous to cut off. That then he was true man,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> made of a woman, this one Act, were there no other, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But to be made of a woman, as I hinted in the beginning, is not that we must trust to. This very Incarnation will not make him Jesus to us. How many are there who are borne of women, that yet cannot save? He that will save by justice, must come under the Law, submit himself to all such du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and penalties as the Law exacts of those he means to save, or else it is in choice of the Superiour, whether they be the better for him.</p>
                  <p>By a strong hand or power he intended not to save; it was by payment, and making full satisfaction to justice; which that he might do, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to come under the Law; and to give assurance that it was so, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Seale of Circumcision in his flesh. Then instantly he became a Debtor of the whole Law; then bound to observe every <gap reason="foreign">

Then, even then he shed some few drops as a pawn, that he would, when time was, shed all the rest for us: as this in the stable, so that in the Hall and Garden; as this in the Cratch, so that on the Cross.</p>
                  <p>Look on Christ then as our Surety, as one that stood in our place, and then very just it is, that he go under the stone-knife. 'Tis now no courtesie, but justice. Pity indeed it is to see a poor innocent put to paine, and lie weltring in his blood: but if this innocent person will put himself into the place of the guilty, bring himself under the Law, and subject himself to the penalty of the Law, no remedy, the Law must take its course, and justice proceed.</p>

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.45.</note>To give you a little more light about this matter; in Christ there be two capacities. It was so in the first <hi>Adam;</hi> it may as easily be conceiv'd in the second. The first <hi>Adam</hi> was a person of himself; and he was againe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of a race, or Head of a Society. And so Christ the second <hi>Adam</hi> is a single and individual person existent of himself; or else a part of that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible body called the Church.<note place="margin">Eph. 5.23.</note> A part I say, though the chief part, the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:200414:107"/> Head, and all Christians besides; some more noble, some inferiour parts of his body.</p>
                  <p>Take Christ then now by himself as a person existent without any relation ro us, so he is an innocent person, a Lamb without spot, Sanctified from the womb; no reason or justice at all that you circumcise him.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.9.</note>
                     <hi>For the Law was not given for a righteous man.</hi> But take him againe as joyn'd with us, and part of us, and then there is all the justice in the world, that he do as we do, and suffer what we suffer, and bleed as we bleed.

In our bodyes parts there be, that, as I may so say, undertake for the whole; as the arm very often is let blood for the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

                     <hi>2.</hi> Eighth day.</head>
                  <p>That was the time. You see how at unawares I am fallen upon it, and do not think but there be good reasons for this very circumstance, as for the Act. As he would be Circumcised, so also he would on the eighth Day.</p>
                  <p>First, In the prime institution of this Sacrament, the Law was,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.12. Lev. 12.2.</note>
                     <hi>That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very male which was eight dayes old should be circumcised,</hi> which Law is revived in <hi>Leviticus.</hi> Time is but a circumstance of action, and yet not in this our Saviour would be deficient; as he was under the Law, so also he tyed himself to the Circumstances of the Law, and would not so much as transgress this. This was the time set by God, reviv'd by <hi>Moses,</hi> observ'd by the Jews, and was to continue till Christ by his death abolished the whole Law of Ceremonies. And this institution of God was without question the true reason why Christ would not be circumcised nor before nor after the Eighth Day.</p>
                  <p>But why, you'le say, was it deferr'd so long, since the Law was so strict, that an uncircumcised man was to be cut off from his people? by the Sword,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Godw. Antiq.</hi> lib. 6.1.</note> say some; but others, to be esteemed as one who was without the Covenant, and therefore to have no benefit at all by it, no more than a leg or an arme that is cut off from the body.</p>
                  <p>It is presumption to give a peremptory reason of Gods Commands: So it pleased him, should conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t a sober minde. But the curious will not be so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. Ye shall heare therefore what the Jews said to it, and then the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. The Jews superstitiously conceiv'd, that each creatures perfection de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the Sanctification of one Sabbath day at least; and therefore they tell us, that God enjoyn'd the day, that one Sabbath might pass over each male, before he should be admitted into the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>But the Christians more probably conceive: First,<note place="margin">Lev. 22.27. &amp; 12.2, 3.</note> That in this time of the Mosaical Paedagogy there was a legal uncleanness, in which the creatures were rhought to be as remaining in their blood. Secondly, To shew that God in matters of salvation, neithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was, nor is tyed to Sacraments; for then there had been no less cruelty in forbidding Circumcision till the eighth day, than there was love in permitting it upon the eighth, when the Parents received comfort by the mature initiation of their children.</p>
                  <p>And now I shall tell you why I mov'd this Question. It was to comfort
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:200414:108"/> and inform some ignorant people, and to confute some Heretical, both which conceive that the Sacrament is absolutely necessary to salvation; so that if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, even children depart this life, they are not sav'd.</p>
                  <p>But how vain and cruel this Assertion is, appears even by the delay of Circumcision. For can any conceive that God would have deferr'd it for eight dayes (in which intervall of time many millions dyed) had it been absolutely necessary to salvation? It is the contempt of the Sacrament, this same <hi>nolle circumcidi,</hi> and that which answers to it, <hi>Nolle Baptizari,</hi> to be against Infants Baptism, that God takes ill, to cast off the means, which he hath ordained, when it may be had: For when it cannot be, and yet is desired, he will not impute it. Though God hath tyed us, yet he hath not tyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; the grace of God may be imputed without the Sacraments; and I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubt but it was extended to many Infants whose foreskin was not cut, and to some of those who dyed in the wilderness, when Circumcision was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for fourty years.<note place="margin">John 5.5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But I return to these eight dayes. Musick they say consists in numbers; and most true it is, that all voyces or instruments tun'd, by their parity or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity, produce a Symphony; you shall hear then what Descant the gravest Divines have run upon this Diapason, this Eight. For some apply it Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, some Mystically.</p>
                  <p>First, That this eight day falls out to be the first of the year, it teacheth what we are to have in mind all the year. <hi>viz.</hi> The blood of Christ this day shed as a pledge, that he would shed all the rest for us. For there was a double effusion of his blood; First at his Circumcision; the other at his Passion. Now an Infant,<note place="margin">Luke 21.2.</note> he shed a few drops, as it were the two mites, and cast them into the treasury of the Church; little they appear to be, but they are of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite vallue and comfort; for they are a pawn, that by the stream to follow, all our debts shall be paid, we shall be enriched, we shall be saved, we shall live for ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That this Circumcision followed so quickly upon his Birth; it shews that mortification of our fleshly members, and the Cross of Christ is not to be deferred to our old age,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, That this is <hi>Novi Testamenti numerus,</hi> the number of the New Testament. For that our Lord rose out of the grave the next day after the Sabbath,<note place="margin">Hierom. in <hi>Ezek. 20. &amp; 40.</hi> August. de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.

                     </note> which was the eighth day from the first of the Creation. The Jews kept holy the seventh, but we under the New Testament the eighth in memory of our Saviours resurrection on that day.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That it is <hi>numerus aeternitatis,</hi> a number that puts us in mind of eternity. In the six dayes whatsoever was made, must also perish; the seventh day itself was not to continue, no nor the service done in it. The day was but a shadow that must give way to our Lords day,<note place="margin">Joh 4.23.</note> and the service meere Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, that must yield to our worship in Spirit and Truth. The eighth day, the day we now keep must last, and the honour of it to continue to the worlds end. After which there remains <hi>Sabbatismus,</hi> a rest to the people of God, an eternal Sabbath in heaven. This must be after the resurrection, of which this Sabbath,<note place="margin">Nazian. orat. <hi>43.</hi> Hug. Victor. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Sacram. part. <hi>12.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>

                  <p>Salvation is the fruit, salvation is the end; for that end he was born, for that end circumcised. The Obligation he entred into at his Circumcision was to save, and therefore then, and not till then he had his Name given him, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus a Saviour. A wonderful and strange thing, <hi>Circumciditur puer &amp; vocatur Jesus,</hi> he is circumcised, and yet called Jesus. He is circumcised, and that makes him a Servant, for by this sign he was mark'd to be one of Gods people under the Law, and bound to service. And yet this servant (for so <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 49.6. Phil. 2.7.</note> so St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls him) is more then a servant, for he is Jesus, and must save, which alone belongs to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abram</hi> at his Circumcision received a new name, that honourable name of <hi>Abraham,</hi> because he should be the Father of many Nations,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.5.</note> who should believe and obey, as he did: So Christ at his Circumcision, who, as a man, became now one of the people of God, dedicated to his service and honour, took this wonderful Name of Jesus, because he was to be the Saviour of all those Nations of which <hi>Abraham</hi> was to be the Father according to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>In this one verse then, we have Law and Gospel; The Law observ'd by the sharp knife of Circumcision; the Gospel preach'd under the Name of Jesus. One of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children in that he bled; more than <hi>Abrahams</hi> Childe in that he was Jesus. Majesty and weakness, God and man, Heaven and earth are in this place met together. His Circumcision is an undeniable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his Humanity; The Name given him above every Name,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.9.</note> an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Majesty: what means this connexion? what is the purpose of this great Saviour to conjoyn heights and depths, humane things and Divine together? was it to give us a taste, that he could not be Jesus, a Saviour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shedding of blood? or was it not rather to inform us, that it is peculiar to God to exalt the obedient?

                  <p>But it is worth your observation, that God never forgot his servant. For in his humility his judgement was exalted; when he was at the weakest, then to a diligent eye, he was at the strongest; when so low that he might give an offence, then was there some sign from heaven which might wipe away the scandal. Offend it might, that he should be conceived of menstruous blood; for nine moneths continue in the womb of a woman.

Look on his Birth, therein lies the Lord of glory without all glory, his Palace a stable, his Cradle a cratch, his Pillow, God knows what, the hangings of that room, for ought we know, dust, and cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs, his attendants beasts, or shepherds at the best: <hi>Audistis vilia, audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etis mirifica.</hi>

                  <p>Offend again it may, to see him like any other Jewish Male, to bleed under this sharp and shameful knife; but then call to mind his Name then given, and you have an ample amends made; a Name that is above every Name.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.9.</note> A Name above to him, above to us.

                  <p>Those might and did save the body: This Saviour body and soul together; They could save but from man and carnal enemies; He from the enemies of mankind, and from spiritual. They some one Nation, as put case the Jews: He the whole world. They from temporal calamities, as it were the branches; he from sin, as it were the root. They from enemies and miseries for a time onely, for they came again; he from them, and so that they shall not return. He wrought eternal salvation; Eternal,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.9.</note> which never any Jesus or <hi>Jehoshua</hi> else did. Lastly, they all had need of a Saviour themselves, without whom they had been lost; but he for himself needed none, yet imparts of his salvation to all others who are saved; and if you are desirous to know how this is done,<note place="margin">Mat. 1.21.</note> it was by saving his people from their sin.</p>
                  <p>Yea but youle say, How are his people saved from their sins, when there is not one of his people who are not to this day sinners? <hi>Abraham</hi> a sinner, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> a sinner, <hi>Peter</hi> a sinful man; <hi>And if any man say that he hath no sin,</hi>

                  <p>But O happy sighs and groans! for these if constant and serious in any one of his people, shew evidently that the man is saved. Saved not so far from sin, that it shall not dwell in him and with him, but that it doth not reign in him,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.12. Joh. 5.24.</note> nor shall condemn him. In sin there is a double power, the one <hi>dominandi,</hi> of domineering; the other <hi>damnandi,</hi> of condemning; and from both he hath saved his people. First from that of reigning or domineering, whereby it commands, and men obey, drudge and droyl in its service;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> and such a slave not one of his people can be; for they live not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. And then again from that power of condemning, because <hi>there is no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus.</hi>

                  <p>This name then is an ointment poured forth;<note place="margin">Cant. 1.3.</note> for at the imposition and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation it sends forth a most fragrant smell,<note place="margin">Joh. 12.3.</note> as <hi>Maries</hi> box of Spiknard when it was opened.

                  <p>Thus have you the explication; I now descend to the Application of this text. Brethren, we have in the Circumcision of our Lord what to admire, what to imitate, and in his name what to reverence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It must strike us into admiration to see God in our flesh, God suffering in our flesh, and bleeding in our nature; Was there ever the like heard, ever the like
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:200414:110"/> seem? When I look upon the person, I cannot comprehend the greatness of his Majesty; when I behold the blood,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.22. &amp; 3.18. Joh. 10.11.</note> I am not able to express the greatness of his love. The Innocent would bleed for the sinful, the Judge for the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, the Physitian for his patient, the Shepherd for the sheep, the Creator for his creature, in a word, God for man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obstupescite coeli,</hi> Be amazed O heavens! behold at what rate he esteemed man, and be not like horse and mule, creatures without understanding, but get you to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and behold there the Lord of Angels,<note place="margin">Psal. 32.9. Heb. 2.7, 9.</note> not made onely lower than Angels, but lower than an ordinary person, taking upon him not onely the shape of man, but the form of a sinner, a wicked sinner,<note place="margin">Luc. 19.7.</note> for he is marked in his flesh <hi>quasi quodam cauterio latronis,</hi> burnt as it were and stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the mark of an evil doer. Behold this first, and wonder at it, and wondering love him, and loving rejoyce, and with greater joy be thankful to the head that would bleed for the members, to the head that would dye for the parts, to Jesus <hi>qui totus pro nobis datus, totus in usus nostros expensus,</hi> to Jesus I say who was wholly given for us, wholly expended and laid out for our use.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But to wonder is not much; seldom is there any strange thing which men will not gaze at; or to love and be glad is no hard motion to perswade, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally men do love and will joy in that which shall make for their good and benefit. We have then here somewhat more to admire, somewhat to set us to work; the Circumcision is for our imitation; we, even we, yet though the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be gone, have what in this Ceremony to follow.</p>
                  <p>There is a Circumcision of the heart,<note place="margin">Jer. 4.2.</note> a cutting off of whatsoever is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, whatsoever is sinful, and in this we must all be Jews. Cut off pride, that thou maist be vested with Christs humility; cut off thine own will, that thou maist put on his obedience; cut off thine anger and fury, that thou maist receive his patience. Cut off the love of thy self, that thou maist be marked with the love of God. Coveteousness must go under the knife; wantonness under the knife, gluttony under the knife, sacriledge under the knife, blasphemy under the knife; in a word all the lusts of the flesh under the knife, they must be cut off and cast away from us if we mean to receive the seal of Christ.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5.23. Mat. 6.22. Rom. 2.29.</note> The Jew was circumcised in one part onely, but the Christian is to be circumcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the whole man; the Jew outwardly, the Christian within; the Jew in the flesh, the Christian in the heart; the Jew in the letter, the Christian in the Spirit; <hi>Ye are circumcised</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>not with circumcision made with hands, but with the circumcision made without hands,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3.11.</note>
                     <hi>in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be it that this be grievous to flesh and blood, yet so God will have it; there could be no cutting without pain, nor bleeding without incision; 'tis contrary to the nature of Circumcision, that the circumcised smart not. When you are then to be circumcised with Christ and for Christ, you must be content to smart, to suffer, to abide pain, or else you can never be within the Covenant; think not that God hath strewed your way to heaven with roses;<note place="margin">Mat. 7.14.</note> 'tis a sharpe way that leads thither, the way of mortification; the rough way of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the strait gate of abstinence and fasting, and the bloody path of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tends to happiness; in one word, death is the gate of life, and these as so many circumcisions must be undergone by us, before we can wear a Crown;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.6. Col. 3.9.</note> the old man cannot be put off without trouble: ye have now what to imitate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But in the last place once more be pleased to cast your ey upon the name Jesus, &amp; you have a name to honor &amp; worship. Humility it was in him to take the name, but greater humility to take it at a Circumcision; now because he thus humbled himself, <hi>Therfore hath God given him a name above every name,</hi>

Then, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath it, was fulfill'd what our Saviour said to <hi>Nathaniel, You shall see the heaven opened, and the Angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.</hi> Then things in the earth bow'd, when some of all Nations, Jews and Gentiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converted, confessed his Name, and fell low before him. These gladly, willingly, chearfully. But for things under the earth, Devils, and foul spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits fell low before him; when, though unwillingly, by this very name they were forced to depart from those they possessed, and put to silence in those Oracles, and compell'd to leave those Temples where they had been of old a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored. All things then in heaven, in earth, and under the earth, bow'd to the Name; They that had knees bowed in kinde; but those that had none, did bow with the knee, as they did confess with the tongue, that is, their way, by something that is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bish. Andrews</hi> Serm. in Phil. 2.</note>Look unto the Text then, and let no man perswade you, but that God requireth a reverent carriage even of the body it self. And namely, this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the knee, and that to his Sonnes Name. What to the syllables? to the sound? I say it not; but to the person, whose name it is, yea, and that you take an occasion to do it, when this Name is with reverence brought to your eares. This is that Name above every name; above, as I but now said, to him, above to us. To him, for to purchase our Salvation (which was the joy that was set before him) he endured the Cross,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> and despised the shame. No man cost him so deare; it cost him his honour, it cost him paine, it cost him blood, it cost him his life before he could be our Jesus; and that which cost him so dear, as it is dear to him, so it ought to be dearly respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by us.</p>
                  <p>So it ought: But alas, what is more cheap! we take it in our mouths as familiarly, as if it were some common name; we prophane it by a vaine and idle Oath. Many, who know not what manner of person he is, will yet have <hi>By Jesu</hi> in their mouths, more readily than Jesus Christ our Lord at the end of their prayers.</p>
                  <p>But this is the least injury, I feare me; the Name is become very cheap indeed, even by those who would be taken for his sole Servants; men, that vote it to be superstitious to bow at it;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide Scult.</hi> in Isa. 45. &amp; 23. <hi>Zanch.</hi> In loc.</note> That it hath been used to superstition, I have read some that say; that upon some reasons it might be forborne, and for some reasons used, I reade also; but never did I heare or reade till this age, that it was unlawful to bow at it; never the reverence done at it, scorn'd for <hi>Jesu-worship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Will you but with patience heare what may be said; the Text is known, <hi>At the Name of Jesus every knee shall bow;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.10.</note> and all Expositors, even they who are against bowing, profess, that with the <hi>Heart</hi> all veneration, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, fear, bowing may be done to the Name.</p>
                  <p>O gross stupidity, or wilfull blindness! shall we yield that the heart may bow, and not the knee? what grant the more, and yet deny the less? which I pray' is the greater service? that of the heart, or that other of the knee? the interiour, or the exteriour? Well now, put case there be superstition in the bowing at the Name, where lies the guilt? within, or without? in the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:200414:111"/> heart, or in the knee? Within certainly, as well as without; either then let them both be allow'd to bow together, or both be denyed to bow; which yet I never met with any, who spoke of this Subject, durst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme.</p>
                  <p>That men do it at the Name of God, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Christ, I know not any deny; but that it be done at this Name especially, peculiar reasons there are.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Those Names never were in such disesteem as this. This was brought low by the Jews: This derided by the Gentiles: This scoffed at by <hi>Julian</hi> and all Apostates: This set upon the Cross in scorne: and then there is great reason, that all they who hope to have salvation by it, highly exalt it; and the next way to exalt any thing that is low, is to fall low before it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nay, among Christians there were and are, that would not have it the Name of God. The <hi>Arrians</hi> did and do deny his eternal Generation;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zanch.</hi> in Phil. 2.</note> and to confute these, it was a very Ancient and laudable custome in the Church to bow at his Name. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> to this day use it. <hi>Scultetus</hi> grants,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Scult.</hi> in Isa. 45 <hi>Vorst.</hi> apol. per. Eccl. Belg.</note>
                     <hi>Si cum animi devotione id fiat, landandum;</hi> That if it be done with the devotion of the heart, it deserves praise; and more we require not. And <hi>Vorstius</hi> saith, That the Churches of the Low Countries have no Act, no Canon for it; but yet, <hi>Si quis velit, per nos licet;</hi> If any man be dispos'd to bow his knee at the Name, he may freely do it. With which moderation also <hi>Scultetus</hi> concludes his decision of this point.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I shall add these reasons, <hi>verbatim,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bish. <hi>Adrews</hi> Ser. in 2 Phil.</note> taken out of that Worthy of our Church, whom I honour in his grave, Bishop <hi>Andrews.</hi> He moves the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, Why to this Name, more than to the Name of Christ? The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Christ is not, cannot be the Name of God? God cannot be anointed. But Jesus is the Name of God, and the chief Name of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Name of Christ is communicated by him to others:<note place="margin">Isa. 43.11.</note> So is not Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that is proper, <hi>I am, and beside me there is no other;</hi> and ever that which is proper, is above that which is holden common.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Christ is Anointed to what end? to be a Saviour. Ever the end is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the means: Ever the name of health, above the name of the medicine. I add, that there be many now adayes that deny his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Socinus.</note> the price he laid down for our health, as the <hi>Socinians;</hi> good then to bow, to shew we are not of their judgement.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But when we finde expressely in this verse, this Name exalted above all names, and this Act limited to it in direct words, and so this Name above them in this very peculiar, why seek we farther?</p>
                  <p>Thus farre that Learned and Pious Bishop; now I proceed. Not to do it, to omit it, and leave it undone, is very doubtful: But to deny it, to forbid it to be done, to mock and scoff at those who do it, is methinks a kinde of Julianisme. Will you then take the safest way? To omit it, may be dangerous; to do it piously, cannot be sinful: and therefore, as I may, I must do reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the person of my Saviour, so will I take an occasion to do it upon the mention of his saving Name; and so much the rather,<note place="margin">Zanchy, Hooker, Whitgift.</note> because I have the Declaration of my Mother the Church of <hi>England</hi> to direct me, and an Universal practice of the most conscientious Christians for many Ages.</p>
                  <p>To Conclude, if Christ be Jesus, if Jesus God, all reverence, interiour, exteriour, is too little for him. The homage of the heart, the bowing of the knee, the confession of the tongue, are all his due. And if ye cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to yield it, yet be not of the number of those that do deny it, that do forbid it, that scoff at it, nay, that persecute and brand those that do it.</p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:200414:112"/>
                  <p>Therefore God hath exalted his person, that we should exalt his person; therefore God hath given him a Name above all names, that we above all names should honour it. Whatsoever good we can desire or expect, is to be found in this Name. Is life good? <hi>Jesus is the life.</hi> Is Resurrection good? <hi>Jesus is the Resurrection.</hi>

Jer. 23.6.</note> Is the light good? <hi>Jesus the light of the World.</hi> Briefly, <hi>He is the way, the truth, wisdome, power, righteousnesse, a full treasury of all good things.</hi> All good things we have in Christ, and Christ Jesus is all good things to us. If thou desirest to cure thy wounds, he is the Physician; if thou art fcorch'd with a feverish sinne, he is a Fountain; if loaden with a burden of iniquity, he is thy righteousness; if thou needst help, he is power; if thou fearest death, he is life; if thou desirest heaven, he is the way; if thou hatest darkness, he is light; if thou seekest meat, he is food and nourishment; O taste and see how gracious, how sweet this Name Jesus is! blessed is the man that hopes in him.</p>
                  <p>O blessed Jesus! thy Name truly to me is an ointment poured forth! thine shall I call it, or mine? Both I confess; thy name now and mine: Thine because thine is salvation, and it proceeds from thee: Mine, because it is wholly imparted to me, and imposed for me. The Name of Christ is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, from which I have the anointing; but the Name of Jesus to me more proper and useful, by which I am saved. For the Name of Christ is partly his, and partly mine; mine for him, and his for me. But he was call'd Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, not for himself, but for me alone: For he needed no Saviour, that was no sinner. I was the sinner, and for me he took the Name; my Spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall rejoyce in God my Saviour; my heart shall bow to God my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and my knee shall bend to God my Saviour; and my tongue shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess God my Saviour; and my life shall express God my Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Because this Name of Jesus is for me, I will also be wholly for Jesus; no longer mine own, but his; his Disciple, his Servant, his follower; my Lords wholly to obey his Will, to do his Commands; that as from Christ the Lord I am called a Christian▪ so from Jesus the Saviour I may be Saved.</p>
                  <p>O deare and sweet Jesus! would I might be wholly thine, as thou art made wholly mine! Let thy Name be to me an Ointment poured forth, a fragrant smell and perfume, senting me with Blessing, Salvation, and life for ever and ever. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

The high Priest <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> the Elders and Scribes, with the whole Assembly begin to Act their parts, but with so much malice and injustice, as was never save once parallel'd.</p>

                  <p>Their proceeding was judicial by a Legal form; a form I say, for there was much packing in it, as there is too often in tryals of this nature; where the person to be araign'd is condem'd before he is heard. But you'l say, what suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could there be of any unjust practice, where the High Priest, and the Lord chief Justice had the hearing of the matter? For he was examined and tryed in both Courts, Ecclesiastical and Temporal,<note place="margin">Joh. 18.13, 28.</note> before <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the high Priest in the great Consistory at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and before <hi>Pilate</hi> the civil Judge in <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio</hi> or the Hall of judgement. But both Courts condemn him too too often; <hi>Pilate</hi> the President with the Assembly of the Elders, joyn together to condemn the Innocent King of the Jews.</p>
                  <p>He is first brought to the house of <hi>Annas,</hi> that forsooth they might honour the Father in law of the high Priest,<note place="margin">vers. 13. vers. 30.</note> with the first sight of so notorious (as they thought and call'd him) a Malefactor; but from him he is amanded to the man of Authority, the Superintendent <hi>Caiphas,</hi> who was High Priest that year:<note place="margin">vers. 24. vers. 19.</note> There he is examin'd of his Disciples of his Doctrine: Of his Disciples he

                     <note place="margin">vers. 23.</note> This was the first blow our Saviour received, and he puts it up without either shew of dislike, or ill word, replying calmly, that if he had spoken evil, he might bear witness of the evil; if not, it was an injury to be so light fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd. O admirable pattern of patience! he meant to teach us in Gods cause being strucken,<note place="margin">Luk. 6.22.</note> to turn the other cheek.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Court was full; for the chief Priests, and Elders, and Scribes were all assembled;<note place="margin">Mar. 14.53.</note> not to see as men in place and authority ought, that there should be a fair and a just proceeding against the Prisoner; but with a malicious thirst for his blood.<note place="margin">vers. 55.</note> Be his cause never so just, himself never so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, concluded it was that dye he must.

                     </gap>l the strife. A course too well known, and too wickedly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the world at this day, when many an innocent is outed of his life, honor, land, possession, by suborn'd and forsworn witnesses. But it was in the night when this deed of darkness was done, and none follow it but the servant of the Prince of darkness.</p>
                  <p>Their own consciences could not choose but tell them, that to plot thus for the blood of a man, had he been a malefactor, was an unjust course. However this way is approved: where the wood is sere and dry, what a small spark kindles it? False witnesses were sought for; were these Judges or Wolves think you, who did not deliver as they ought, but thirsted, as they ought not, after the blood of an innocent Lamb? what needed all this ado? dye he must, that was decreed: A sentence from the High Priests mouth would have done the deed without any more trouble. Ay but a legal tryal would have a fairer colour of a just proceeding, the packing discern'd by few; or if that, who durst open his mouth against this high Court of Justice? Hypocrites so they can avoid the sword of man, little regard the all-seeing eye of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Long it was ere they could find these, for they sought, but found none to their mind, for their witness agreed not together. I fear me, had they liv'd in our times, they might have met with them sooner, and Jurists more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.<note place="margin">Mat. 26.60.</note> At last appear two grave Knights of the Post, and they depose, that they heard him say, <hi>I will destroy this Temple made with hands, and raise it up in three dayes;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 2.21.</note> and was not this true? were they not his own words? No such thing, either for matter or manner. Nor for manner, for he said not, I will destoy, but bade them do it: Do you destroy; not for matter, for he said, <hi>this Temple,</hi> meaning his Body; they added, <hi>made with hands,</hi> which his was not, being fram'd by the Holy Ghost. Thus they chang'd both words and meaning, an usual property of false witnesses.</p>
                  <p>To this scandalous accusation Christ answers nothing. A foole is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to answer according to his folly.<note place="margin">Prov. 26.4.</note> Besides, at this time he was to suffer, not to contest, and to contend; <hi>Like as a Lamb brought to the slaughter,</hi> to dye,<note place="margin">Isa. 53.7.</note> not to cry, <hi>and therefore he opened not his mouth.</hi> Such also hath been the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:200414:114"/> patience of the Saints, <hi>who being reviled, reviled not again;</hi> suffering,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.23, 21.</note> they threatned not, but committed their cause to him who judgeth righteously, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his steps who left the example.</p>
                  <p>His silence and patience the Chief Priest admires, and therefore the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to pick out matter of accusation, adjures him by the living God,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.63, 64.</note> that he tell them whether he were the Christ, the Son of God: Jesus though silent before, yet in reverence to Gods Majesty, returns a plain answer, Thou say'st it, or thou hast said the truth, for I am he. O thou hard-hearted Jew, look no more for another, never stand gaping for a Messias longer; for another thou shalt never see,<note place="margin">Ver. 64.</note> till thou see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. Behold, he hath told thee.</p>
                  <p>Truth to some ears is the most unwelcome errand: So it was to these Jews;<note place="margin">Ver. 65.</note> to them a true assertion was blasphemy, and upon the hearing of it, they fall to tearing of their clothes, whereas they should have torn and rent their obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and malicious hearts in which there was so much envy, hatred, and injustice concieved against the person of our Saviour. Now saith <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> What further need have we of more witnesses? the blasphemy was apparent to them,<note place="margin">Ver. 66.</note> so that the whole Assembly, as if they had but one tongue, joyn in his condemnation. He is guilty of death; so went the general vote, and therefore let justice be done upon him: Guilty of death? how was that possible? could that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, who never did any thing amisse deserve to dye?<note place="margin">Luk. 23.41.</note> could the Lord and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of life become worthy of dearh? could the breath of our nostrils, deserve himself not to breath? He was worthy ten thousand of us, nay all of us,<note place="margin">Lam. 4.20.</note> and was he now not held worthy to live? He was the Repairer of the breaches, the Redeemer of the guilty, the Enlarger of the Prisoners;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.3.</note> and must he be now broken and found guilty, and come into bonds himself? Yes, yes, so it must be; thus it behoved Christ to suffer. Guilty of death he is, and worthy to dye; but not for himself, not for any evil he hath done.<note place="margin">Joh. 11.50.</note>
                     <hi>One man must dye for the people;</hi> better one than all the Nation perish, saith <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> ignorantly indeed, though maliciously. Our person he sustained, and our person brought the guilt upon him: 'Twas not his own, but the sin of the Nation that brought him to his end. The guilt of death was our portion, our desert: His, because he would be made sin for us: <hi>The Lord hath laid upon him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity of us all.</hi>

                     <hi>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off my haire; I hid not my face from shame and spitting,</hi> saith the Prophet in his person. The beauty of that face which glads the Angels, is deform'd with their filthy spittle; those eyes which see all things, they Hypocrites as they are, hope to cover and put out with a poore vaile: He that knows all things past, present, and to come, and revealed them to his Prophets, is here derided as if he were some blind Wizard, or ignorant Fortuneteller: Thou the Christ, thou the Messiah!<note place="margin">Joh. 4.25.</note>
                     <hi>when he comes he shall tell us all things;</hi> if then thou be he, riddle who it is that smote thee.

The first at the fire, when he simply denyed him; the second in the porch, when he denyed him with an oath: Neither of these blows could be easily borne; but the last was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, when he began to curse and swear that he knew not the man. At this blow, as I may so say, our Saviour did startle, he looked back, and he looked upon <hi>Peter,</hi> pittying the weakness of man in his fearful servant; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he went out, and wept bitterly; he bath'd the greenness of his wound with a river of brinish tears, and that no question gave his Lord and Master some ease: more bitter this blow had been, had it not been for his speedy repentance.

                  <p>Thus have we presented you with the third Act of this Tragedy, in which <hi>Annas, Caiaphas,</hi> the chief Priests, Elders and Scribes were the main Actors. I come now to the fourth, where I shall present you with new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Ver. 3.</note> an unjust and timerous President, a mocking King, and profane souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but all conspiring the death of the King of the Jews. For that was the first question that <hi>Pilate</hi> proposed to him.</p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:200414:115"/>
                  <p>For the better understanding of this whole Act, consider you must what the state of the Jews was at this day. A little before the birth of Christ, the Jews were subdued by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who taking the government into their own hands, appointed them Governors of their own. At this time <hi>Herod</hi> held the jurisdiction of the Northern part, the hilly country toward Galilee; and Pilate was the Deputy in the rest of Jewry. And thus much the Jews confess,<note place="margin">Joh. 18.31. <hi>Godw. Jew. antiq. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> when they say, <hi>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,</hi> that is, in such a case as this, which is plain sedition and treason, especially at this time being the preparation of the Sabbath; and therefore they brought our Saviour to <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he being the President, might judicially proceed against him, examine, arraign, and give sentence upon him, for that he said he was a King;<note place="margin">Joh. 19.12, 15.</note> for you shall find that when all failed, this was the point they pressed home to <hi>Pilate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold here the brethren of <hi>Joseph</hi> rising against their own natural brother,<note place="margin">Gen. 37.18, 28</note> and putting him into the hands of the <hi>Ishmaelites;</hi> the Jews of whose seed our Saviour came according to the flesh,<note place="margin">Mar. 15.10.</note> put the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> into the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Gentiles; the cause was the very same, envy and malice. This is a raging and heady passion, that most commonly feeds upon blood, oftentimes in act, alwayes in desire. If there be envy in the heart, there will be an evil eye, an evil and bloody hand if possible, and an evil tongue.</p>
                  <p>This caused them to frame an enditement of several Articles. 1. Of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2. Gaulonitism. 3. Treason.<note place="margin">Luk. 23.5, 2.</note> A seditious person they charge him to be, stirring up the people, beginning from Galilee to this place; disobedient, forbidding Tribute to be paid to <hi>Caesar;</hi> and a Traitor, saying, that he was Christ a King; when indeed he was nor this, not that. But this is an old de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise of <hi>Machevillians,</hi> that bring such in danger of the State,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 21.10. Act. 24.5.</note> they labor to ruine. <hi>Naboth</hi> blasphemed God and the King; <hi>Tertullus</hi> flaunts it out in his Rhetorique, <hi>We have found this man a pestilent fellow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If to stand in the gap, if to maintain the Truth, if to defend the Law, if to preach the Gospel to the poor,, if to heal the broken-hearted, if to preach deliverance to the captives, if to set at liberty those who were bruised,<note place="margin">Isa. 61.1. Luc. 4.18.</note> if to preach the acceptable year of the Lord, and to proclaim all these, be to be a seditious person, then the allegation cannot be denyed; for such a seducer he was, and other end in seducing he had not. But if they intend, as they did,<note place="margin">Leo. de pass. Ser. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> one who drew a multitude after him to disturbe the peace and quiet of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was nothing more untrue. The first part then of the charge was a manifest aspersion; and the second a flat lye, no better then a starke lye; for how did he forbid the payment of Tribute, who commanded it? confessed it a debt and paid it, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>to Caesar the things which are Caesars.</hi> A debt then it is, not a gift, and debts must be paid, <hi>Ow nothing to any man.</hi> Now that his practice might be conformable to his doctrine, he sent <hi>Peter</hi> to the sea to fetch so much money out of the mouth of a fish,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.8.</note> as should pay for them both. He was then no Gaulonite in the disswasion of Tribute:<note place="margin">Joh. 6.15.</note> Neither ever had he any thought of an earthly crown or scepter; when the people sought for him to make him a King,<note place="margin">Luc. 12.14.</note> he conveyed himself away and hid himself; nay he would not be so much as a subordinate judge, to divide the land betwixt the two dissenting brerhren; but there is nothing so false, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so untrue which a scandalous tongue will not fasten on the Innocent, or the Wolf lay to the charge of the Lamb; he must be devoured, and to that's enough, <hi>Pater, mater, omne tuum invisum genus sedulo mihi adversatur; Tu ergo dabis hodie poenas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Howsoever this last charge because it reflected on the person of <hi>Caesar, Pilate</hi> takes special notice of it; for the bed and the crown are tender things, they may be no more toucht then the eye. Upon this point therefore he examines him,

                     <hi>Thou saist it;</hi> as if he should have said, O <hi>Pilate,</hi> although thou see me sold as a slave, apprehended as a thief, bound like a fool, humbled like a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, accused like a malefactor, and defamed for raising tumults; yet know, that I am a King; a King I am, but not in your sense; and a kingdom I am over, but not such as <hi>Tiberius</hi> your master governs; it is not of this world; You rule over the bodies of men, I over their hearts and consciences; you govern by your laws, I by my truth and Gospel; your subjects obey for fear, mine for love; they hear your Edicts, these my voice; yours is an outward and temporal, mine a spiritual and everlasting kingdom. With which answer <hi>Pilate</hi> rested so fully satisfied,<note place="margin">Joh. 18.38.</note> that he went out, and said to the Jews, <hi>That he could find no fault in him at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 18.28.</note>But by the way I pray observe, that <hi>Pilate went out to them;</hi> what needed that? youl say; were not his accusers in the same place face to face? No, they were not: Saint <hi>John</hi> plainly saith, <hi>They themselves went not into the judgement hall, least that they should be defiled; but that they might eat the Passover.</hi> What name to call this sin by I cannot well tell, whether superstition or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie; both indeed it was, and of both in them we have a notable example. They never stick to seek the life of a just innocent man, and yet are very strict and curious about a ceremony. To hire false witnesses to condemn Christ, a trivial matter; marry to enter into <hi>Pilates</hi> hall would defile them. And doth not <hi>Rome</hi> afford such superstitious hypocrites at this day? to eat an egge in Lent, a bit of flesh on Friday, is a mortal sin; but to excommunicate and interdict, to embrue their hands in the blood of the Lords Anointed, is a meritorious Act. Thus Hypocrites too often Tithe mint and cummin, and omit the great and weighty matters of the Law. But I must return to <hi>Pilate:</hi>
                  </p>

Vers. 16. Joh. 18.39. Luc. 23.22.</note> First he sends him to <hi>Herod;</hi> then he caused him to be scourged▪ Lastly he puts it to their choise whether they would acquit him or <hi>Barabbas.</hi> He that wants an example of a wicked Judge may remember <hi>Pilate.</hi> For if Christ were by the testimony of his own conscience blameless, why doth he post him over to another Judge? why whip him, why scourge him, why bring him into the scale with <hi>Barabbas?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 24.</note> Here he should have interposed his power, and not have delivered him to the will of them he knew to be his enemies. For a Magistrate is a Protector,<note place="margin">Is. 1.17.</note> and bears a sword to keep off a blow from the Innocent, as well as a sword to fasten a blow upon the neck of a notable malefactor. Had Christ appealed to <hi>Herod, Pilate</hi> might well have replyed, <hi>Ʋnto Herod shalt thou go.</hi> But when he stood to his judgement, he was bound, being an Innocent, or one who had done nothing amiss, to acquit him.</p>
                  <p>The Jews no doubt were very well pleased with <hi>Pilates</hi> order. For they little doubted that at <hi>Herods</hi> hands he should fare no better then <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 14.10.</note> who was <hi>Vox clamantis, The voice of one crying;</hi> and he that had cut out Christs tongue, was not in their opinion like to spare the head.

Not a house into which he enters, if they bid him welcome, but he brings salvation with him. But this was not it that made <hi>Herod</hi> glad; he regarded neither his name nor his help. It was meerly to satisfie his curiosity.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:200414:116"/>2. For he hoped to have seen some miracle to have been done by him. He thought no better of him, then of some Magician or Mountebanke, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought into the presence of a King begins straitway to shew his impostures. The very account that Christ finds with great ones at this day, when a buffone with his sophismes and delusions is of great account, but a true servant of his is made a spectacle to men and Angels. O strange folly, to expect a wonder,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.9.</note> and not to regard his words! God grant many Christians be not guilty of it, who are perfect in the story of the Bible; but for any sound sentence, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible argument to direct or reform their lives, they regard not. And this in all likelihood was the reason, that though be asked many things, yet our Saviour gave him no answer, made no Sermon, wrought no miracle before him,<note place="margin">Joh. 18.9.</note> as knowing his intention to be vain if not malicious, no way to be bettered or to profit by him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For all this the chief Priests and Scribes desisted not,<note place="margin">Vers. 10. Luc. 23.10.</note> they prest the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p n="4">4. Now <hi>Herod</hi> seeing our Saviour stand before him, as he was indeed, a Lambe, a Sheep, took him for a simple man, a man that had tongue enough before an unlettered multitude, but no audacity to speak before him, and therefore <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, he set him at naught, he plaid upon him,<note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note> as if he had been some worthless fellow; and as followers usually follow the example of their King, his men of war did the like. They with him scorned, scoffed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided him, made a may-game of him, and when they had jeered their fill, they claded him in a gorgeous coat, such as Kings wear, because he said he was a King; and thus clad in scorn sent him back again to the President <hi>Pilate.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note> The conclusion was that <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were friends that day; both though before enemies, yet agree well enough to put the Lords anointed to death. Men of dissenting judgements yet soder and unite,<note place="margin">Psa. 105.15. 1 Chron. 16.22.</note> when any mischief is to be done to Christ, or to such whom they are commanded not to harm, no not to touch.</p>
                  <p>There is, there is such a thing as conscience, that awakes in the heart of the drowsiest sinner. As this carries a whip to punish after the fact, so also it hath a bridle to curbe and restrain before the deed be done. <hi>Judas</hi> he felt the lash, and complained of it after his treason,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.4, 5.</note>
                     <hi>I have sinned in betraying the innocent blood;</hi> and it lashed him so, that it lashed him to the gallows; a just reward for a Traitor. They bite upon the bridle, that say before the fact, What do I?<note place="margin">Luc. 23. Vers. 14, 15, 16</note> where about go I? how can I do this great wickedness? <hi>Pilate</hi> at this time champed upon the bit; his very conscience reined him in, and told him, 'twas no good matter he was about; not lawful that a just man should be condemned, and therefore he puts on foot another project to save his life.</p>
                  <p>A custome the Jews had, that at <hi>Easter</hi> tbe Deputy should release unto them one prisoner whom they would;<note place="margin">Vers. 17. Mat. 27.15.</note> a custom pteserved perchance in memory that they themselves had been prisoners in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that at this time they were delivered from thence. Well, <hi>Pilate</hi> takes from hence an occasion to present unto them Jesus and <hi>Barabbas;</hi> gold and dirt, a diamond and glass, the Sun and darkness,<note place="margin">Joh. 18.39.</note> heaven and hell are not more unlike then Jesus and <hi>Barab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas.</hi> For Jesus was a just person, one that had done nothing amiss, and of this then witnesses enough, and all his enemies; but this <hi>Barabbas</hi> a notable theif, one who for murder and insurrection was cast into prison; <hi>Pilate</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:200414:117"/> imagined that the Jews could not be so notoriously wicked, as to prefer a murtherer before Christ, a malefactor that was not worthy to live upon the face of the earth, before a just man; that then he might this way acquit him, he presented them both together; but behold here the disposition of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude animated by those in power; for the people are as water, the breath of a great man the winde that insensibly moves it. This people moved by their superiors streightway clamor, Not this man, but <hi>Barabbas; Vivat Barabbas, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat Christus;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 23.18, 21.</note> let <hi>Barabbas</hi> live and let Christ dye; away with him, the cross is fit for him, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him.</hi> Could there be a rejection in a fouler degree? <hi>Non hunc,</hi> not He, Away with such a fellow from the earth, 'tis not fit he should live, had been a soul indignity; but to bring him into the scale with <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and to make <hi>Barabbas</hi> outweigh him; to prefer a murderer, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturber of the peace before him, was an intolerable injury. If it were our case, heaven and earth should ring of it. What compate me to such a Varlet? what prefer him before me? Yet thus it went now, <hi>Barabbas</hi> is loosed, and Jesus refused.</p>
                  <p>Still <hi>Pilates</hi> conscience fretted and chaffed, and murmured within him; it told him, that this was no good dealing thus to condemne an innocent; and to quicken it the more,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.19.</note> his wife sends to him, that he should have nothing to do with the blood of that just man; Therefore he casts about, and at last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes him to a more desperate shift then all the rest.<note place="margin">

And was not this think you a glorious sight?</p>
                  <p>If you be not moved to compassion with this, go on, and you shall behold the King of Israel in his royalty and glory indeed; in a crown, with a Scepter, in a purple robe,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.29.</note> men enough about him, bowing the knee and crying, <hi>Hail thou King of the Jews;</hi> of the Jews indeed, for none but Jews would ever so have used their King.</p>
                  <p>A crown, and a scepter, and a purple robe! who can do less then take him for a King? Mark their knees and tongues, and you have less cause to doubt.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:200414:117"/> But go on to the end of the verse, and you shall see to what purpose all this was done; not to his honour, but his dishonour; not to please, but to grieve him. For that tongue which cryed, <hi>Ave Rex Judaeorum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 30.</note> spet and spued in his face; and that hand which put on his Crown, knockt it with a Cane fast to his head.</p>
                  <p>Besides, his Crown was of Thornes. Thornes in their Crowns, that is, sharp-pointed miseries and afflictions Kings too often beare; you know who grasp'd it as sharp as it was. But no King ever wore a Crown made of Thorns besides this one, When they cloath'd him with purple, that went no farther than a jest, but in this Coronation there was paine and torment; for look how many Thornes did enter through his skinne, so many sluces there were for his blood to issue. The blood gusht out, where the Thornes went in; and now stream'd as fast down his face in the Palace, as it did down his back and shoulders at the Pillar.</p>
                  <p>I should have acquainted you, how before they Crown'd him with this prickly Coronet; they put off his Coat, that garish Coat,<note place="margin">Verse 28.</note> in which <hi>Herod</hi> array'd him, and put him on a purple Robe. O the wonderful patience of the Sonne of God to be thus cloathed and uncloathed; uncloathed and cloath'd by these miscreants! Surely their hatred was so great to him, that by their good wills they would have chang'd him to another: And thereupon it was that they chang'd his skinne, when they scourg'd him; they chang'd his estate, when they arraigned him; they chang'd his dignity, when they scoff'd him; they chang'd his family, when the Officers waited upon him; they chang'd his Name, when they mis-call'd him Seducer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They chang'd his Apparel, when in <hi>Herods</hi> Livery, and in <hi>Pilates</hi> purple they abused him. And was not the King of <hi>Israel</hi> very glorious, this day? this day, when he was thus derided?</p>
                  <p>Thus derided: But there is a third scoffe no less grievous than the other two; yea, as some think, beyond them; Those touch'd his body, this more directly wounded his honour, which every noble spirit prizeth beyond his life. <hi>Kill me,</hi> saith <hi>Saul, lest the uncircumcised come upon me, and mock me.</hi> Now in his Honour, by the reed put into his hand, he suffers:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 31.4.</note> For the reed is an empty, hollow thing, naturally without pith in it, by which they would intimate, that the braine and head of Christ was as empty of wit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no more worth or substance in it, than that hollow Cane; that He was a great mocker, and his Kingdome no other than a great mockery.</p>
                  <p>And to testifie so much, they bow'd their knees, and whet their tongues. The tongue and the knee are the two chief instruments in our outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. God calls for them, he will be adored by them. He swears it in <hi>Isaiah, Every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess the Lord.</hi> As if he had said,<note place="margin">Isa. 45.23.</note> I have sworne, That none shall be so bold to open his mouth, but only to praise me; none shall be so irreligious as to bow his knee, if it be not to worship me. But see here the quite contrary; These miscreants bend their knees, but it is to scoff him; they make use of their tongues, but it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile him. On their knees they would prove him to be a fool, and with their tongues they would prophane that very Word by which they should honor. <hi>Av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Mat. 20.17. Luk. 18.31.</note>OUR Saviour going up to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> acquaints his Disciples that he should be betray'd to the chief Priests and Scribes, that he should be condemned by them, and deliver'd to the Gentiles, be mocked, spitefully entreated, and spet on, that they should scourge him, and put him to death. And to that I am now come, which is the last Act of this Tragedy, the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest that ever was presented. The Sunne became pitch, the earth quaked, the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:200414:118"/> Temple split, the graves gaped, the dead awak'd upon the sense of it;<note place="margin">Mat. 7.45.1.52, 53.</note> and therefore I hope you will not heare it with a cold heart, with dry eyes.

                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3.1.</note> Christ going to, and suffering upon the Cross. A sad and heavy spectacle in it self, but to us matter of joy. So great joy, that the Apostle in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it, rejects all other, <hi>God forbid, that I should rejoyce in any thing,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6.14. 1 Cor. 1.22, 23.</note>
                     <hi>but in the Cross of Christ:</hi> and God forbid, say I, that we should rejoyce in any thing, but in the Cross of Christ. For howsoever the Jew looking for wonders, and the Graecian looking after wisdome, do and did both condemn the Cross; the one of weakness, the other of folly; Of folly, that the Sonne of God should leave his Throne for a Cross of paine and shame; that he should there hang, bleed, expire, and die: Yet we, who by this Cross are become heires of the promise, must make it the object of our joy,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17. 1 Cor. 1.18. Isa. 53.5.</note> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly object of our joy. <hi>For Christ crucified, is the power and wisdome of God to save all them that believe;</hi> and this Cross is the foundation of our Faith, Hope, and Joy. For from his paines it is that we are eased, <hi>by his stripes that we are healed;</hi> his weakness is our strength, his shame our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his death our life. Oh how truly the Prophet said,<note place="margin">Lam 3.58.</note>
                     <hi>Domini fecisti cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam meam! My cause, O Lord, thou hast pleaded, and made good. Mine,</hi> not thy own, considering that he had no business to sollicite for himself, no cause to go up to that accursed Tree,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13. Isa. 53.5.</note> except it were to dye for our sinnes, and to pay for our transgressions, <hi>for the chastisement of our peace was upon him.</hi> Since then the cause was ours, and his the payment and pain, great reason we have to sit down, and sadly to cast up an accompt of what he paid and suffer'd for us.</p>
                  <p>The last day you beheld our Saviour betray'd by <hi>Judas,</hi> abjur'd by <hi>Peter,</hi> forsaken by his followers, apprehended like a Thief, pinioned like a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, falsely accused, unjustly condemn'd, buffeted, spet on, revil'd, whipt. Now I, nay his enemies bring him to the Cross, where you shall behold his eyes dejected for shame, his eares glowing with taunts, his mouth sowred with Vinacre, his hands and feeet wounded with Iron Spikes, his bones unjoynted, his sinews pricked and strained, his whole body hanging by the strength of his hands and feet, and his heart pierc'd through with a Spear and sorrow.</p>
                  <p>But before he comes to <hi>Calvary,</hi> let it be consider'd what he suffer'd by the way. First they disrobe him.<note place="margin">Mat. 27.31, 32.</note> The purple Garment put upon him in scorne, was thought too good for him; that then they took off, and put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him his own.

                  <p>This Cross was so great (for it is supposed, whereas other Malefactors carried but a part, they laid upon him the whole) that he fainted under it. He had lost so much blood before by the Whips and Thornes, that he might
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:200414:119"/> well faint now. Not to ease him then, but forc'd by necessity, when Christ had carried it more than half of this Dolorus way, they met with one <hi>Simon</hi> a <hi>Cyrenian,</hi>

In the old Law, No Redemption without shedding of blood; either the sinner must dye, or else the beast for him;<note place="margin">Levit. 3.4.</note> and this was the reason that under <hi>Moses</hi> no sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice could be propitiatory, except it were bloody. The blood of the beast must be shed before the sinner, who was to dye, could be set free, and restored to the favour of God. Christ was the substance of all these sacrifices; their blood the Type of his, and his the power and virtue of theirs; we were the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors that must have dyed; be or we, that's certain; our blood or his must satisfie; ours could not, because but finite, the blood onely of a creature; his could because of an infinite worth, being by the Mystical union the blood of God, and this he would shed rather then we should dye.</p>

And this I call the depth of Christs Cross, because there is no misery will pierce a heart more deeply than reproach and shame; and alwayes the more noble the heart is, the deeper the wound. For two things are most precious; our life, and our reputation; they go both arme in arme.

His soul was alwayes quickned by the Spirit,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18. Joh. 11.42.

                  <p n="2">2. Can we say, that he was properly accursed, who procured a blessing for us? Yea, but the Apostle in express words saith so much,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Curse. For there is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the curse emphatically express'd by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a Curse set without an Article. Betwixt these two there is a vast difference. For the Curse includes in it Detestation, the worm that never dies; Obligation to eternal punishment, with all the Concomitants. A Curse includes no more than hanging on the Tree, to which by the Law Malefactors were adjudg'd; and in that sense accursed, because they shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ended their dayes. The first was properly the curse of the Law, which includes Gods detestation of sin, his commination against sin, his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in proportioning punishment for sin, and his justice in executing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sinners. The second proceeds from the Law, and includes no more than the penalty due by the Letter of the Law, and in this life to be executed upon a Malefactour, according to those words of <hi>Moses, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is every one that hangs upon a Tree;</hi> should we extend them farther,<note place="margin">Deut. 21.23.</note> damn we must the good Thief upon the Cross, and all other who die that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death.</p>
                  <p>To apply this to our purpose in the Apostles words, <hi>Christ redeemed us,</hi>

But most cleerly <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Hierom,</hi> Christ was made a

Christ was made a curse, as he was made sin and foolishness; but sin and foolishness he never was made truly and properly; and therefore he never was a true and proper curse for sin. Away then with this ill-sounding word <hi>Accursed;</hi> or if it must be kept, let us never stretch it farther than will stand with the Apostles intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Fathers Exposition, and our Saviours Honour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And as for the Fire which they cast into Christs soul, who taught them, that in this world any man could in soul suffer the paines of Hell? Hell fire is no Allegory, but a true and real flame; whether material or immaterial, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute not; but prepar'd to torment first the Devil and his Angels, after the bodies and souls of men;<note place="margin">Mat. 25.41.</note> and the late fiction of Familists, and Quakers, that Hell was only the sting of a guilty conscience, was long since condemn'd in <hi>Origen</hi> by the Church of Christ. Besides, were this opinion true, how is it possible, that he should be subject to the sting of sinne, which was never sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to sinne? that is <hi>the sting of death,</hi> saith the Apostle; and he means it of inherent corruption.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.50.</note> And how was it then conceivable, that the stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging paines of the second death shall fasten upon that person in whom there was nor seed, nor root, nor branch, nor fruit of sin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for the perpetual paines of this fire, they who cast him into it, free him from it. Flame it did, say they, during the Agony in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, his last cry and complaint on the Cross; but upon his death they put it out.</p>
                  <p>But I pray, upon what ground? Sure I am, they may not, if they will stick to their own principles. For do they not tell us, <hi>that the whole wrath of God, and the full Ʋials of his wrath must be poured upon his Son? that he must suffer in kinde all that we were to suffer?</hi> what? are his Vials of wrath now by them shortned that administer them? and his whole wrath not whole?

That in his soul he suffered all these, we do allow.

                  <p n="2">2. Next I affirm, that it is not required by the Rules of equity, as they

                  <p>God was offended and wronged by all mankinde in <hi>Adam,</hi> and requisite it was that his justice be satisfied to the highest degree. Man, had he been condemned to pain for ever, could not have done it. His own Son therefore undertook to become our Surety; and all that God could require of his Son,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.22.</note> was to make full satisfaction according to the Rule of justice; which, as I have shewed, is not alwayes the self-same, but somewhat that may be equivalent to it. Thus much we know might be accomplished by our Saviour after a more excellent manner, than by suffering Satan to exercise his malice upon him, and to torment his soul.</p>
                  <p>Pain, it is confessed, he suffered for our pain, paid for our disobedience by his obedience, for our impatience by his patience, for our want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition by his sorrow, for our obstinacy by his feare, for our irreligion by his reverence. There is not a sinne for which he hath not made full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>Be it that sin be infinite: So was the satisfaction infinite also; and far more truly infinite than sin. <hi>Non quia passus est infinita, sed quia qui pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus est erat infinitus;</hi> Not because he suffered infinite pains, but because he that suffered them is infinite.

That which gave efficacy to it, was, that he offer'd himself without spot to God, to purge our consciences from dead works, to serve the living God. <hi>Vide Thom. Aquin. part</hi> 3. <hi>Q.</hi> 48. <hi>Art.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Let men talk then no longer, <hi>Christum nihil egisse morte corporali,</hi> Christs bodily death was of no value; that except he died in soul, our soul must die; that the paines of his body will make him only <hi>Corporum Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorem,</hi> a Redeemer of the body. For the matter is far otherwise; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ suffered in body and in soul, and because the punishment of this person was of an infinite price. What it wanted in extension of time and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity, is made up by the intension of his sufferings, and dignity of the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:200414:124"/> person. Temporal death so condition'd, must needs be a sufficient price for an eternal death, for so much as Gods holiness is highly pleased with the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Gods glory greatly advanced by the Humility, and Gods justice fully satisfied with the submission and patience of his Sonne upon the Crosse.</p>
                  <p>Into gross errour men often runne through incogitancy; they compare Christs body without ours, his person with a common man; and therefore equal him in the passion, and in the payment; because the paines of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies can make no satisfaction for the soul, they conceive this of his also. But it would be considered, That the measure, nature, and quality of paines must be taken not so much from the force and violence of the Agent, as from the condition and temper of the Patient. <hi>Actus agentium sunt in patiente rite disposito,</hi>

Nor the wrath of God, and vengeance due to sin, which would have affrighted any other man into despaire, could have the same power upon Christ: It was not able to conquer his Faith, Hope, Love, Patience; which it must needs do, should he have suffered the Hellish paines in his Soul.<note place="margin">Mat. 27.46.</note> He confesseth <hi>that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken, and wanted comfort in his troubles;</hi> and asks only, <hi>Quare, Why it should be so,</hi> and says no more.</p>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:200414:125"/> are these doublings felt by you? is this want of comfort lamented? would you not despaire? then wipe away those teares; what you feele, and abhorre, will not hurt.

The Angels stoop't to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, the Patriarchs long'd to see it, the Prophets foretold it, the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists related it, and out of them I have spun a long Narration; and yet notwithstanding all, I have said it is a mystery; and before we can know all we ought (for all in this world we never shall) of it, it must be farther search'd.</p>
               <p>Now nothing is ever well searcht, till we arrive at the Cause. Thither till we come, new things beget in us wonder, and sad things amazement; and so may the passion set us to admire, put us to a melancholy dump. Read what goes before this,<note place="margin">

To remove then this scandal from the Jews, and to cease all admiration, and dry up the tears of believers, the Prophet from Gods mouth in these words acquaints us, why Christ was thus bruised, thus slaughtered, thus put to pain.

                     </gap>, his good pleasure; sometimes mercy, or the riches of his mercy. Call it by what name you will, it is but one and the same fountain whence our salvation flows; for except it had been for his loving zeal, and zealous affection; his affectionate pitty, and his piti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ul good pleasure; his meer mercy, and his abundant goodwill; it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived what it was that should move him to bruise his Son.</p>
                  <p>And two circumstances there are in this verse, which do wonderfully amplifie and magnifie this his goodwill and mercy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is in <hi>eum</hi> the pronoune, that he should bruise him, that he should put him to grief, make his soul the sacrifice. First, For this person was no less then God; the greater the person, the greater the mercy; for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> then to lay upon him that was God of God, light of light, our iniquity, to cause him who was to receive sacrifices to become a sacrifice, must needs be a strong argument of love. Secondly, Again, this <hi>Eum</hi> here was his Son; had he been ours, the winde might not blow on him.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.33.</note> We reckon of a son as <hi>David</hi> did of his <hi>Absalom, O Absolom my son, my son, would God I had dyed for thee!</hi> What riches then of mercy was this unto mankind, that he would not spare his own son,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note> but take delight to bruise him! In the creation of the world, <hi>Dilexit</hi> he loved; but it was not <hi>sic dilexit,</hi> so he loved, till it came to mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.1.</note> In the preservation of all things <hi>ostendit charitatem,</hi> he shews his love; but till it came to this point, it was not <hi>Ecce quantam charitatem!</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how great love he shewed! not how great love with an <hi>Ecce</hi> before, Come and behold it; enough I confess it had been, considering our estate, to have been relieved by any, and men in misery care not by whom it be done so they be relieved. Here then is goodwill indeed, and it makes the measure of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will full, that for mans salvation he would bruise no less person then his Son. Thirdly, And yet there is one thing behind that makes it fuller; Had this Son been a disobedient child, then good reason to bruise him; or had God had more sons, this matter had not been so much to sacrifice him. Here there is zeal and love, and goodwill, that he would make this his onely Son bear the burden, that he would make that Son in whom he was well pleased, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;<note place="margin">Gen. 22.12, 16.</note> God himself extols this love in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his son, his onely son, his <hi>Isaac</hi> that he loved, the son of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s age, the son of his desires, the heir of his love. How then shall we stand amazed at the goodwill of this <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that not onely gave, but took delight to give his onely Son, the Son of his love, who had never displeased him, to death for our sin!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And that's the other circumstance that heightens, this love, because it was for sin; to it vengeance is due, and not love. What then did God love our sin?<note place="margin">Rom. 5.6, 8.</note> No, he hated that, but he loved the sinner; his intention was that sin should dye, but the sinner live, though an enemy, a weak enemy, an ungodly enemy. In this then he commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ dyed for us. But of this more by and by.</p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:200414:126"/>
                  <p>The question is moved by <hi>Thom. Aquin.</hi> Whether it was Necessary for Christ to suffer for the Redemption of mankind? A curious question,<note place="margin">Thom. <hi>3.</hi> part. q. <hi>46.</hi> Artic. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> and not easie to resolve; for peremptorily to avouch, that God could not have remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the sins of the world without a full satisfaction, is a bold and sawcy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; yet on the other side, to say that sins could have been forgiven without an amends made, would be a rash and unsound assertion. The best way then to resolve this doubt, will be to remember, that some things are done upon Necessity, other upon convenience: And this Necessity is again twofold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is absolute, without which it is impossible the thing can be brought to pass. Now to tye God out of an absolute Necessity to do as he did, and not to leave him at liberty to do all things according to his own will and wisdom, were to revive the old error of the Manichees; and in this case not absolutely requisite, whether you respect God, who was to redeem, or man to be redeemed. For out of question he could,<note place="margin">Zanch. in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. <hi>2.</hi> Calvin. in Joh. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> if he had pleased by his sole word, will, nod, have redeemed man; or else he might have empowred some Angel, or other creature to have done it, and a creature so empowred might have trod Satan under his feet.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But out of his meer love he Decreed to have it done by his Son; and this Decree being presupposed, then we say, <hi>Oportet</hi> it behooved Christ to suffer; his Son must dye and so dye. And this is the sense of all those texts, that seem to impose a Necessity of his death; as, <hi>The Son of man must be betrayed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 26.54, 20, 17. Mat. 9.31. Luc. 24.7.</note>
                     <hi>must be delivered to the hand of sinners; must give his soul a sacrifice for sin,</hi> &amp;c. of which decree if you yet enquire the reason, the Prophet shall give the answer, <hi>Jehovah voluit, It pleased the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But if you shall again cast an eye upon the congruity and convenience of this way, in that sense, none so necessary, none better to shew his love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, as I shewed but now; none like this to demonstrare his Wisdom, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Goodness, Justice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Wisest way (if wisdom can contrive it) to cure a man stunge by a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is to do it by the blood of the Viper; that what brought the mischief might be cause of the remedy. Hence it is, that wise Artists have found out the oyl of Scorpions, to cure the bitings of Scorpions, and Mithridate made of Serpents, to prevent the poyson of Serpents.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The most powerful way (if power can effect it) is to make strength to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in weakness, and by infirm and unlikely means, to bring to pass the greatest things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The next way (if goodness will admit it) to engage man, is to lay the Bond upon his own Nature, and not to engage him to man or Angel for his delivery.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And now let Justice take her weights, and weigh all in her scale, and found it will be that there can be no juster way found out, then that that self same nature which hath offended, do also make recompence. Now in this work of mans Redemption, there was the concurrence of all these, Wisdom, Power, Goodness, Justice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The flesh, the Venemous flesh of our Viperous Nature was by the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God taken, and first purified and cleansed from the poyson of sin; then bruised and punned, that the blood of it might be as a Balsom or Treacle to heal the biting and venemous sting of the old Serpent; I mean Satan. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Wisdom!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Man, the Nature of man, a weak creature God knows, and so much the weaker now, because it was in the form of a servant, yet enabled to break and bruise the serpents head. Behold power!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For this, God would not have us beholding to any of the Angels, to any of the creatures, but meerly to himself. Behold goodness!</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:200414:127"/>4. Lastly, since as the Lawyers tell us, that those are alwayes the fairest and justest satisfactions and commutations, when the wronged party is fully in iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity recompensed; for as they say, <hi>proxima sunt idem &amp; tantundem.</hi> Therefore this way must needs be most convenient, where Death was to be suffered for Death, pain for pain, man for man, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Nulla necessitate, sed plena voluntate;</hi> that not upon compulsion, but upon meer good will, that not out of any Necessity, but freely, Christ of God became a servant, of rich became poor, of high low, of strong weak; was voluntarily Incarnate, voluntarily bruised, voluntarily crucified for our sake. The Psalmist had said it in his person long before, <hi>In burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin thou hadst no pleasure;</hi> then said I, <hi>Lo I come,</hi> of my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, willingly, cheerfully, without any co-action, <hi>to do thy will, O my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of this truth we have this evidence; There was no moment in which his death, and the kind of his death, together with the very hour, and all the indignities and pains of it, was not represented to his minde; yet the will of God was so powerful, and his love for mans salvation so fervent in him, that the remembrance of it was full of joy and content to him; of which joy and pleasure we have a sufficient argument from his own mouth, I have a Baptism to be baptized with (it was <hi>Baptismus sanguinis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 12.50.</note> his baptism of blood at his Passion) and how am I straitned, how pinched till I am at it! as if he were in pain,<note place="margin">Luc. 18.31.</note> till in pain to deliver us. This could not be till he came to <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> thither he ascended,<note place="margin">Mar. 10.32.</note> and told his Disciples to what purpose; and yet he went before them with such alacrity, that they wondered at it. Into the City he rode in Triumph, with palms, with acclamations, with so much solemnity, as he never admitted all his life before.</p>
                  <p>Farther yet, at his last Supper he gave a full signification of this his will, when he said to his Disciples,<note place="margin">Luc. 22.15.</note> This, this is the Passoever, which <hi>Desidererio deside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravi,</hi> I have so longed for, as embracing and welcoming his death.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:200414:127"/> the Synagogue crowned him with thornes,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> the day of the gladness of his heart. In his heart this joy and gladness arose out of a thought that he was to save man, and for this joy set before him, he endured the Cross, and despised the shame; this was to be most painful and most shameful; none but Malefactors, none but slaves of a base condition were liable to it; and not one of these did suffer it willingly, or out of obedience; but for want of power to eschew it. Had it been in the power of the most abject slave that ever suffered to have called so many <hi>Romane</hi> souldiers to his rescue,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.53.</note> as Christ Jesus could have commanded Legions of Angels, he would have sold his life at a deare rate.</p>
                  <p>But the man Christ Jesus was brought to the cross as a Lamb;<note place="margin">Isa. 53.7.</note> he opened not his mouth, gave not one high word; even Lambs dye not willingly, but with some strugling and reluctation. Whereas this Lamb of God to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the mirror of patience, and voluntary obedience; after the pangs of death more then natural had seized upon him; after he had been apprehended and bound as a theif; after he had been buffeted, spit on, scourged, crowned with thornes, reviled; after he had endured the lingring and cruel torments of the cross; after all the indignities and jeers of his malicious persecutors,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.48.</note> that poured Vinegar into his wounds in stead of Oyl, yet gave not the least signification of discontent.</p>
                  <p>As there never was any sorrow like his sorrow,<note place="margin">Lam. 3.12.</note> so never was there obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence like his obedience; never any so voluntary, never any so free; He gave his soul a sacrifice, <hi>se ipse,</hi> He, himself. He humbled, saith the Apostle; He the Son of God, what person greater? He, himself, of a willing minde, not upon force and constraint; for he had no superior. And so great was this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, so strange this obedience,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1. Now this willing offer of Christ, as it sets forth the riches of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to man; so it was also the very life and soul of that admirable obedience of his Humane will, to do and suffer whatsoever he did or suffered in his flesh; that which gave the infinite value and everlasting efficacy to his everlasting sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which was offered once for all.</p>
                  <p>No service that we do to God, is welcome except it proceed from a glad heart, and a cheerful spirit. God loves a cheerful giver,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.7. Psal. 32.9.

How much more then must this readiness, this alacrity, this cheerfulness of his Son, that He exposed, He poured out, He emptyed himself, He freely gave his blood, make all the Acts of Christ meritorious for the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again this willingness of his is that which justifies God in his proceeding against him; For God forbid, that as <hi>Ananias</hi> the High Priest,<note place="margin">Act. 23.2. Gen. 18.25. Isa. 53.9.</note> God should cause him to be smitten without a cause; God forbid, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> said in the case of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the Judge of the world should do wrong to any; to any, much less to his Son, the Son of his love, to him a righteous person, in whom there was found no guile. How then came it to pass, that so righteous a person was thus bruised, thus sacrificed? Whence? Meerly from himself, he may thank no body but himself, <hi>Ipse voluit,</hi> He would have it so; 'tis all I can say to it, and more need not be said.</p>

                     <hi>Volenti non fit injuria;</hi> You cannot call that an injury which a man calls for on himelf; pity it is to see a man pay that he never took, great pity; but
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:200414:128"/> if that man willingly will become a Surety, and make himself a debtor, what remedy? satisfie the debt he must: Pity it is to see a poor Lamb lie bleeding under the knife, but if the Lamb be chosen for a sacrifice, such is the Nature of a sacrifice, so it must be. And great pity it was to see a just man to pay, to bleed, to be bruised, to be sacrific'd, to dye: But since this just man would take upon him to be our Surety, our sacrifice, of his own accord to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for us, justice might take its course and proceed against him.</p>

                     <hi>4.</hi> For Sin.</head>
                  <p>Sin was the cause of his and our sorrows also; for had man stood in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, he had needed no Saviour; but falling from that perfection in which God had created him, in stead of love, he procured Gods anger; instead of an immortal life, he brought upon himself eternal death. God who was his Creator, became now his Judge; of his Father, a severe revenger. God and man then standing upon these terms of variance,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> his Son steps in, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make up the peace; to free us, and translate the sin upon himself: Or, to be made sin for us.</p>
                  <p>Now that you may understand this point aright, know you must that sin is either committed, as by <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Angels; or inherited, as by <hi>Adams</hi> posterity; or else assumed, as by Christ, and this way onely he was made sin for us, Not so sin as if he committed any, for no Lamb so innocent; not so as if he inherited or contracted any,<note place="margin">Exod. 29.14. Levit. 4.29. &amp; cap. 7.7.</note> for he was undefiled; but as the sacrifice in the Law was called sin that was the creature on which the delinquent laid his sin, and for this sin put to death; which being done, the anger of God was appeased, and the sinner received to favour. It was so here, Christ was made sin, that is a sacrifice for sin; and upon his death, Gods anger was pacified, and man the sinner received to mercy.</p>
                  <p>Man having offended, just it was with God to receive satisfaction from the delinquent. Now a man becomes <hi>Reus,</hi> i. e. Guilty, two ways, either by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for his own offence, and so Christ was not guilty, nor could be punished; or else by affinity, connexion, conjunction, neerness, alliance, or Relation, which ariseth out of a threefold bond.</p>
                  <p>The first is of Nature; such is betwixt man and man, Father and Son.</p>
                  <p>The second is of Union; such a relation there is betwixt a King and his people.</p>
                  <p>The third is of the Will; and such is the obligation of the debtor and the Surety. And as men have and do stand in these relations one to another, they have been and are justly punished one for another; as <hi>Achans</hi> children for the fathers theft;<note place="margin">Josh. 7.24, 25. 2 Sam. 24.15, 17.</note> seventy thousand poor sheep of <hi>Israel</hi> for <hi>Davids</hi> sin, and the Surety every day pays for the creditor.</p>
                  <p>Now every one of these ways Christ was joyned to us. By nature, for he was bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, but this onely made him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of punishment. By relation, for he became our King, we his people; he our head, we his members. By his own free-will, for he became our Surety, and therefore taking our flesh to that purpose, and our debt upon him freely and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, God might justly lay upon him our sins, that is the punishment of our sins, as I said before.</p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:200414:128"/>
                  <p>And lest you should forget this, the Prophet tells us it seven times over,<note place="margin">Isa. 53.4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12.</note> He took upon him our griefs, our sorrows; he was wounded for our iniquities, and broken for our transgressions; the chastisement of our peace was upon him, with his stripes we are healed; The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all; all, all, every one of us. We were the men, who for our many sins should have been so despised, so rejected, suffered such sorrows in body in soul, that should have been thus smitten of God, wounded, bruised.</p>
                  <p>Let us return a true verdict, and it will appear, that we were men that thus used the Son of God, we and our fathers together; we and our friends and children together; we who gave him those wounds, those stripes, we that so chastised him, so bruised him; we were the principals in the murder; <hi>Judas, Caiphas,</hi> the Jews and <hi>Pilate</hi> the instruments onely to execute what by our sins we had effected, <hi>Peccatum solum homicida est,</hi> Sin alone was the murderer, that, of which we are guilty.</p>
                  <p>There is not one of us here who had not a hand in his death, except he that dare say his heart is clean; however we desire to post it off to others, yet we had a hand in it as well as they. Why stand you gazing one upon another? like <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren, wondering that you should be charged with so heinous a fact, as if every one of you were ready to ask me in the disciples language,<note place="margin">Marc. 14.19.</note>
                     <hi>Master, is it I?</hi> and another, <hi>Is it I?</hi> Yes, as <hi>Nathan</hi> told <hi>David,</hi> so I tell you,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.7.</note>
                     <hi>Tu es homo,</hi> Thou art the man; 'tis thou, and thou, and thou, and I, and every one of us, that put to death the Son of God; thou and I as well as others were the transgressors for whose sins God hath smitten, wounded and bruised him. There's not an oath we vainly or falsly take, but was a thorne in his crown; not a leud action we commit but was a stripe on his back; no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief we plot; but was the spear that runs him to the heart. Fools make a make a mock of sin; but see here what comes of their fooling and mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Son of God to redeem them, is fain to make his soul a sacrifice.</p>

                  <p>At the Creation of man they all meet, and are joyn'd in him. Mercy was his Guardian to protect him, his servant to attend him in all his wayes. Truth his Tutor to teach him, and bring him up in all goodness. Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness his Rule to proceed by in all his Actions. Peace to be his faithful friend to delight him, to secure him, that nor fears within, nor troubles without, should molest him. At <hi>Adams</hi> fall they left their charge; and forsaking their dwelling below, return'd back to him that sent them, making report of what was fallen out in the earth, and earnestly soliciting the Almighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this his wretched and forlorn creature Man; yet in a very different sort and manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3.4. Psal. 116.11. Rom. 13.4.</note>Of these Mercy seems to favour man, and peace also; these wish all well in heaven and earth: But of righteousness and truth I dare not say it. For truth proclaimes, <hi>All men are lyars, all vaine in their imaginations.</hi> And <hi>righteousness bears a Sword, and it is not in vaine.</hi> Two then are for us, and two against us.</p>
                  <p>First, Mercy taking into consideration the depth of mans misery, begun
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:200414:129"/> and spake first; And well might; for if you consider it,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.4. Tit. 2.11. Eph. 2.4. Rom. 9.23. Luk. 1.78.</note> you shall in no text reade of mans Redemption, but still mercy leads the way. Sometimes it is the Bounty of our Lord and Saviour, sometimes the love, sometimes the grace of God appeared, sometimes the riches of his mercies, sometimes his bowels of mercy. This most useful Attribute is never omitted, nay is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardest for our Salvation. Never, never (which is the comfort of a miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sinner) looking to the party what he is, or what he hath deserved, but what he suffers, and in how wretched a case he is.</p>
                  <p>Mercy then ever lying in the bowels of a merciful God, thus whispers unto him, <hi>Numquid in vanum? What hast thou made all men for naught?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 89.47.</note> All, all to destruction? That were over-severe, and their case worse than the lapsed Angels. They fell, and I ask no mercy for them: For when some fell, yet others stood, and so they did not all perish. They fell again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not tempted by any other to it; it was out of their own pride and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wickedness: whereas mans fall was out of credulity and weakness; he was drawn by the subtilty and temptation of the Serpent unto his sinne and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy; <hi>&amp; levius est alienâ mente quam propriâ peccasse;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> it is a less of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to sin upon anothers perswasion, than by his own inclination. Besides, the fall of man is universal; <hi>with one all men sinned;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> and if thy justice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, all men must die, all men must perish; and wilt thou then create so many millions of men for fuel in Hell? <hi>What profit is there in mans blood, if he descend into the pit? Hath God forgotten to be gracious?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ps. 30.9. Ps. 77.9. Ps. 145.9.</note>
                     <hi>will he shut up his loving-kindness in displeasure? Thy mercy is over all thy works,</hi> and therefore infinitely beyond mans Sinne. Let not then Sinne bring to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the creature framed after thy own Image. Let it suffice, O Lord,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.4. Jude 6.</note> let it suffice for demonstration of thy justice and indignation, that thou hast thrust the proud Angels out of heaven, and reserved them in chaines of darkness. For them I plead not: 'Tis for poor man, made out of the dust of the earth,<note place="margin">Psa. 51.12.</note> and seduced by malice, lapsed by ignorance, not contempt; <hi>Restore him againe to thy love.</hi> And as thou hast made the ambitious Angels examples of thy justice, so make poor man a monument of thy mercy;<note place="margin">Deut. 9.26.</note>
                     <hi>Destroy not thou the work of thine own hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These were the <hi>pij susurri,</hi> the pious and powerful whispers of mercy, with which she entred, or rather lay in the bowels and bosome of her Father, and made them yerne and melt upon his Son;<note place="margin">Luk. 15.20.</note> and no doubt she had prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had not Truth and Righteousness much to plead against her. I am a debtor, saith God, to thy two Sisters, Truth and Justice; they must be heard too; let them then be call'd, and hear I will, what they can plead why thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest may not be granted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Truth then first appearing, puts in her plea to this effect,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.18. Gen. 2.17.</note> Lord, thou that canst not lye, sayd'st first to <hi>Adam, Morte morieris, In the day thou eatest the forbidden fruit, thou shalt die the death;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.20. Num. 23.19.</note> After to his posterity, <hi>The soul that sinnes shall die.</hi> And shall God be like man, to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifie his word? or <hi>as the sonne of man, that he should repent?</hi> Nay, nay, what he hath said may never be revers'd. The sentence is past. What's God but his Word? Mercy it self, if respect be had of my honour, cannot grant an indulgence: And therefore <hi>Totus moriatur Adam.</hi> Let the sentence for truths sake be executed upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his rebellious off-spring. As the whole earth hath corrupted its way before thee, so let the whole earth perish.<note place="margin">Gen. 6.11, 12.</note> Let God be true, and all men lyars.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And immediately Justice steps up, and seconds her Sister Truth;<note place="margin">Rom. 3.4. Psal. 145.17. Gen. 18.25. Exod. 23.7. Act. 10.34.</note> and it is no hard matter to judge what she had to say, <hi>viz.</hi> That as God is true of his word, so is he righteous in his wayes, and shall not the Judge of all the World do right? Art thou a God that will justifie the wicked, or respect
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:200414:130"/> persons in judgement? Thou hast decreed, that no sinne shall go unpunished; call then all the sinners of the earth before thee, and let them render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their rebellions. <hi>Pereat mundus, &amp; fiat justitia; As man hath plowed iniquity, so let him reap the same; by the blast of thy mouth let him be Consumed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 4.8, 9.</note>
                     <hi>and by the Breath of thy Nostrils let him perish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A severe and harsh Conclusion, which made Peace, that stood by and heard what was said by Truth and Justice, weep bitterly, and all the Angels of peace wept with her. Oh saith Peace, forbear, forbear, I beseech you my two deare Sisters,<note place="margin">Psal. 85.10, 11.</note> these harsh words. This contention becomes not the Ladies of vertue. Mercy and Truth should meet together, Righteousness and I should kiss each other.</p>
                  <p>But they as stirr'd, the more went on, and made it their own cases; What shall become of us, said Justice and Truth, if Mercy be heard? <hi>Perijmus, nisi homo moriatur,</hi> We die, if man die not; No justice in God, no truth in his Word, if man be suffer'd to live.</p>
                  <p>And what use of me, replied Mercy, if Justice and Truth prevail? Truth her self knows, that if man die, I must die too; And if I die, then the Father of mercies must die with me.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Nec mihi mors gravis est, positurae morte dolores;</l>
                     <l>Hic qui diligitur, vellem diuturnior esset.</l>
                     <l>Nunc duo concordes animâ moriemur in unâ.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Hard hold there was; and all this while, mans salvation lay a bleeding; like a poor Prisoner at the Bar, it was not known, what would become of him.<note place="margin">Gen. 6.6.</note> Who would not say, that it had been good, man had ner'e been born<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, about whom there was so much ado, so much contention?</p>
                  <p>At last, the Almighty having heard the pleas of all partyes, refers the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal judgement to his Son. What, saith he, is Justice and Truth so earnest? will they die, if <hi>Adam</hi> die not? and is Mercy againe so pitiful, that she will die, if he do die? I will finde a way to content all parties; and with that he steps down, and writes upon the earth, <hi>Fiat mors bona, Let death be made good;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 8.6.</note> and so all parties may have what may give them content. Truth and Justice would have man dye, and he shall dye. Mercy would have him live,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.55, 56.</note> and he shall live. Take away the curse, the sting of death, and both parties may receive full satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Truth upon this Verdict began a little to yield, and Justice was also contented, so she might have satisfaction: That she stood upon, and for that she call'd still; and till that was given, resolved she was, that Mercy should not save man; but the way to obtain this, yet she saw not. Answer was made, that this might be done, if one could be found, who out of meer love and good-will would be content to die for the world. One yet so innocent, and free from sin, that he never had deserv'd to die.</p>
                  <p>With this answer Justice and Mercy departed from the Throne of God. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice goes through the earth. Mercy leaves no quarter of heaven unsearch'd to see, if it were possible to finde a person composed of so much love, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with so much Innocency. But in earth Justice could not meet with the man.<note place="margin">Job 14.4. Psa. 51.5.</note> Every child she met with, were it but of a day old, was conceiv'd of unclean seed, and warm'd in a sinful womb. For men, as they grew in age, so they grew in sin, they all were unfit for this work.</p>
                  <p>In heaven Mercy, though she met with creatures devoyd of sin, yet none indued with so much love or confidence, that they durst undergo the wrath of God, and die for a company of lost people. And yet had they been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:200414:130"/> they never could have satisfied; they wanted a body to do it: They were not persons of infinite worth, of infinite vertue, which he must be, that would satisfie for this infinite wrong, or else Justice would be clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous still.</p>
                  <p>Justice now returnes in Triumph, and Mercy neer dead and despairing to the Throne of God, and both agreeing that Truth should speak for them;<note place="margin">Isa. 59.16.</note> she delivers this great truth, <hi>I see there is no man, and confess there is no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.</hi> But in that instant Peace steps up, and closes all. You my deare Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, know nothing at all, nor understand. <hi>Qui dedit consilium, ferat auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium.</hi> He that hath given the counsel to look for such a man, let him help now, and finde the man himself.<note place="margin">Isa. 9.6. Psa. 40.7. Luk. 19.10.</note> And the Prince of Peace well understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what was said, proffers himself, <hi>Ecce venio, Behold I come to help. I,</hi> (for I know that's the desire of Peace) <hi>will become the Sonne of man to save what is lost.</hi> By partaking the Nature of man, I am content to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his miseries, and subject my self unto his punishments. And by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting my Divine Nature unto his, fill it with all grace and heavenly perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: And if it appeare that I shall do what he was bound to do, and pay for him what for his disobedience he was bound to suffer, the Bond must be voyd, and penalty satisfied, and then though death doth arrest him, yet it shall not be able to detaine him, but <hi>erit optima,</hi> shall be good, as the Sentence was. And thus by this free and voluntary offer of the Son of God, to become the Son of man, and to make his Soul a Sacrifice for sinne, the desires of these Litigants were satisfied. Man was punished as Justice exacted; Man dyed as Truth required; Man was pardoned as Mercy intreated; and God and man reconcil'd as Peace expected. When therefore Truth flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the earth, the second person in the Trinity became the Sonne of man, then Righteousness looked down from heaven. It beheld and saw not only an equal satisfaction, but a superabundant also: Merits of that infinite worth, that they were able to make amends for the sins of ten thousand worlds, and to deserve that reward which God had to give.</p>
                  <p>Such a Title to heaven, such a Plea for a pardon,<note place="margin">Bish. <hi>Andrews.</hi> Serm. 11. de Nativ.</note> no Religion in the world can shew besides the Christian. That some satisfaction is necessary, they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently manifest by their Sacrifices, cutting of their flesh, petitions, prayers, charmes, and other kinds of will-worship; but that any of these can soundly satisfie justice, rests upon them to prove; nay,<note place="margin">Cherb. de veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</note> upon the point they disclaim it; for being put to it, they maintaine this blinde and false Paradox, <hi>Justitiae divinae bonitatem divinam esse</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, That Gods mercy is a full satisfaction to his justice; wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch in other words is as if they should affirme, That because he is merciful, and will forgive sinners, therefore justice, will she, nill she, must be contented with it. For more she shall not have, nor more expect. This were a quick way to obstruct all proceedings of justice; I will, saith the Judge, save this Malefactor out of the mercy I bear to mankind, never there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed farther against him.</p>
                  <p>Among the <hi>Socinians</hi> there is no other way; among the Turks no other way; among our New practical Atheists no other way. Marvel not that I link them together. For I conceive much of their Religion is out of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran. Mahomet</hi> doth acknowledge Christ to be a holy Prophet; and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> doth no more; for a good example he will grant him to be; for to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, his soul an offering for sin, he doth deny. Thus <hi>they deny the Lord that bought them,</hi> and give the lye to our Prophet, who affirms,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1.</note>
                     <hi>That he gave his soul a sacrifice for sin. A sacrifice,</hi> and that (though Legal) when time was, was accepted for satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Accepted I say, for it was not so in it self. The Jew will tell you of his scape-Goat, his Calves, his red Heifer, and a multitude of other Rites or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:200414:131"/> by God to that purpose. But all they had their power, if any, from this one Sacrifice of Christ to be Sacrific'd.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.13, 19. Vers. 9. Heb. 10.4.</note> In themselves the Apostle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that they could not satisfie for sin; no more power in any of these, without relation to Christ, than in a Heathen Ramm, or a Graecian <hi>Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomb.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 10.1. Heb. 7.18.</note> They made no man perfect; short they came of satisfaction to justice. Types they only were of that blood which was to be shed; which being shed, they have no farther use, but are abrogated, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for their weakness and inutility. There is not then any thing, no not in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Religion, nor ever was, that could save what was lost, in strict termes of Justice.</p>
                  <p>And if not there, then sure nothing either among the Mahometans, or Heathens. Ask the Musselman how he hopes for Remission of sin; and his answer will be, That his Prophets prayer shall be upon you. Say his Prophet had been, what he was not, a just, holy man, yet his motion only could have been for mercy. But justice exacts, and expects satisfaction, not intreaties; for real payment, not for words. There is not then in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Alcoran.</note> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to be found for sin. From these, turn to their Predecessors the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; and among them somewhat is to be found, that comes nearer to the point.

                  <p>Now if ever any benefit ought to be chearfully receiv'd, and engraven with the point of a Diamond, it is this.

                     <p>Now that he ascended, what is it, but that he descended first into the lower parts of the earth?</p>
                     <p>He that descended, is the same also which ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.</p>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THese two Verses are inclosed in a parenthesis, and therefore they serve for an Explication of what went before. The Prophet, out of whom the former Verse was taken, foretold Christs ascent:<note place="margin">Psa. 68.18.</note> which being premised and granted, the Apostle makes his inference, partly concerning the Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, partly concerning the Exaltation of our Saviour. He ascended; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he descended; that's plaine: He descended; therefore he ascended again, that's as cleare. In his descent we finde him humbled; in his ascent raised and exalted; both Acts are for his honour, our benefit. We willingly therefore attribute the whole work of our Redemption, to the Humiliation and Exaltation of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>In his humiliation we may finde many degrees; our Creed hath express'd them in few, but full words. To descend to the Virgins womb is one step, and a low step too; for God to be made and born of a Woman, and by that birth to take upon him the forme of a servant, is humility beyond expression! To condescend to hunger and thirst, nay to be scorn'd, mock'd, and scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to be brought to the Cross, there to be crucified under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> an unjust Judge, is another. To die there, and breath forth his soul, and to be laid up in the grave, is yet a third. Thus was he humbled in his birth, humbled by his Cross, humbled in his death, humbled in his grave. Farther I list not to go.</p>
               <p>Now for this his humility, hath God h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ghly exalted him; <hi>He</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>ascended;</hi> in which it is no hard matter to finde as many honours done him. His first ascent was from the grave, his next to heaven, his third in heaven to the highest place, and there to have the honour to have all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers committed to him, to be King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</p>
               <p>Now betwixt these Articles, which concern our Saviours humiliation and his exaltation, as a midwall, stands this one, <hi>He descended into Hell;</hi> which some Divines refer to one state, and some to the other. What you are to judge of it, I shall shew you by and by, being led thereto by the Apostles Text; which that you may the better understand, I desire you to consider the Scope and full intent of the words.</p>
               <p>His purpose in these two Verses was to set forth unto us the whole Office of Christ, that he descended, that he ascended; and why he descended, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:200414:137"/> why he ascended; it was that he might fill all things; and the consideration of both makes very much for his purpose, for he was to perswade to Unity, to Humility; examples are often more powerful than reasons; and can there be any more vigorous example to enduce to either than that of Christ? He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, who can exalt himself; what proud in the presence of an humble God? He ascended, and from above sent down the spirit of Unity; will any man then dare to break the Unity of the Spirit? This is the Apostles scope and intent; these points I have not leasure to prosecute. In the words I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you

                  <p>Now this difference doth not arise out of the ascent and descent; for the acts are and may be affirmed of Angels and men; but from the quality of the person who doth ascend. Never any that came down from heaven, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed a humane body, ascended in that humane body but he; never any, that in a humane body ascended, came first down from heaven but he; which evinceth, that he was not onely man, but God also. Certainly if Christ were meerly from the earth, as we are; the Apostles collection were very weak, nay none at all; he could not have said, he descended first. But let it be supposed, that he was God from everlasting, then it follows necessarily, that his ascent from the earth to heaven, will i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It was then the self same person that descended, and the self same that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended; the same which came from the Father, and the same that went to the Father; yet with this difference, That whereas in his descent, he was onely God, in his ascent he was both God and man. The person was the same, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>ipse,</hi> vers. 10. but otherwise qualified; he assumed our Nature into the subsistence of his person, and took that to heaven with him which he brought not thence.</p>
                  <p>In Christ there was but one person, but two natures;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> for God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in the flesh, which being granted, easie it is to explain these two acts of his ascent and descent, and to know how to attribute them. In the same respect they are not to be taken; for we must refer his descent to what he was before he was man, that is, being God on high, it pleased him to descend, and to be made man; which was no natural motion,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.7.</note> but an empting himself of his glory, and taking upon him the form of a Servant. But for his ascent, it must be referred to that person he then was; God invested with the nature of man, to which we may and do attribute a local motion. Truely then and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in respect of his humanity, he did ascend from earth to heaven, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally as his body arose from the grave; And yet we say, that whole Christ did really ascend <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, because the Attributes proper to one own nature, are attributed to the whole person.</p>
                  <p>When therefore the Apostle saith, he who descended, is the same which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so ascended, he intimates to us two things. First, that it is the same person, to whom these two Acts are attributed; then that these two acts must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood after a different manner, <hi>viz.</hi> That he descended as God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out change of place. But as man he ascended to heaven, and went from us.</p>
                  <p>Who the person is, we now see, and in what sense the Acts are appliable to him. The next is, that we consider the places to which he came, to which he went, about which there is some difficulty; and what interpreters have thought of both, you shall now here.</p>

                     </gap>, into the lower parts of the earth.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Some understand by the lower parts of the earth the Virgins womb, in which the Son of God was conceived and made man; in which sense we find the phrase once used, and but once onely; I was fashioned secretly,<note place="margin">Psal. 139.15.</note>
                     <hi>Tachijoth Arets,</hi> in the lowest parts of the earth, where <hi>David</hi> by a Metaphor resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the lowest parts of his mothers belly, where he was framed and formed, to the lowest part of the earth; noting the strange secret of his conception and formation in his mothers wombe; that from the earth as from a common mother he came, that thither he must return; that below he was fashioned by a secret way, as metals and minerals lye and grow in the depths of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon parent. All which though true, yet I believe it reacheth not home to the Apostles intent; for his purpose is here to expound those words of <hi>David, He ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, he gave gifts unto men;</hi> which was done upon his ascent, not descent to the Virgins womb. Since then Christ during the time of his conception did not lead captivity captive, nor gave these gifts; his Mothers womb cannot aptly pertain to the Apostles purpose in this place; some other sense will be more appliable to <hi>Inferiores partes terrae,</hi> the lower parts of the earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By these parts then others understand <hi>terram ipsam,</hi> the earth it self, which because it is <hi>Insima pars mundi,</hi> the lowest element of the world, is here called by <hi>Hypallage inferiora terrae,</hi> the lower part of the earth; so that here
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:200414:138"/> should not be a comparison of the parts of the earth one to another, but of the parts of the world one to another; so that the Apostles meaning should be no more, but that he descended from heaven to the earth, left the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of heaven, emptyed himself of his glory; took upon him the condition of men, that condition which the poorest, the meanest, the most inferior man on earth hath done; even that of a servant, and subjected himself to our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. But this interpretation is subject to the same difficulties that the former was; and had the Apostle meant no more then his being on earth, he might have expressed it without <hi>inferiora terrae.</hi> Besides, here is a plain opposition betwixt the places whither he came, and whither he went. Now the surface of the earth, bears no true opposition to the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the height to which he ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Descending and ascending, must have contrary extremes, from which, and to which the motion is made; therefore to the highest heavens, to which Christ ascended, the Apostle opposeth the lower parts of the earth, to which he Descended.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Which some discerning, go a step farther, and by the lower parts of the earth understand the grave, and the condition of the dead; and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they alledge those words of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.40.</note>
                     <hi>As Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the Whale, so must the Son of man be three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth.</hi> So that they make here a comparison betwixt the parts of the earth; one the upper, upon which we breath, live, walk; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferior, in which our bodies must be laid after our departure hence. Thus they say, Christ descended into the lower parts of the earth; that is, into his sepulcher, as other men, and that for some hours his body was held under the captivity of death.</p>
                  <p>Thus much must be granted, yet it satisfies not; for here again, a grave some three foot deep, will carry no proportion to the highest heavens; and in his Grave he was led captive himself, then shewed not any conquest over death; that I say not, he gave no gifts to men. That then this his conquest may be full, over Hell, Satan, death, sin, and all the power of darkness, there is yet a fourth interpretation of these words.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Eighteen of the ancient fathers, and twelve of the best modern Divines, do profess that Christ did descend locally to that place,<note place="margin">Bilson p. <hi>544.</hi> Bellar. de desc. c. <hi>14. 4.</hi>
                     </note> which was prepared for the Divel, his Angels, and all wicked men; so that it can be no impiety by <hi>the lower parts</hi> of the earth to understand that place. The grey hairs of antiquity, and the concurrent judgement of the soundest divines hath been always so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable with me, that I never durst steer a contrary course against them, where they oppose not the Scriptures; which since they do not in this point, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choose to tread in their steps, then to follow the mazes of new emptyer men.</p>
                  <p>But touching this place of the Apostle, I willingly admit of all these four ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, every one of them having great authors, and being consonant to the Analogy of Faith; for if <hi>he descended</hi> be referred to the Incarnation, it agrees well with the Article, He descended from heaven, and was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> If to his life and sufferings, to his Passion under <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> if to his grave, he was dead and buryed; if to his entring and invading the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarus,</hi> he descended to hell. Therefore we cannot err from truth, if we say, that he descended to the lower parts of the earth, all, or any of these ways. But because the last is more doubted: two reasons there are alledged by <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zanchy in loc.</note> why he conceives this last sense comes neerest to the intention of the Apostle.</p>
                  <p>First, because here is an evident Antithesis betwixt <hi>above all heavens,</hi> and <hi>the lowest parts of the earth,</hi> as I said before; but that place to which he ascended, is litterally to be understood; and therefore in reason this also. Thus the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:200414:138"/> text will keep just correspondence betwixt his high and his low; that was <hi>ad summa coeli,</hi> the highest top of the heavens, than which none higher; this then <hi>ad ima terrae,</hi> to the lowest parts of the earth, than which none lower, none beneath them.</p>
                  <p>Then again, the Apostle saith not simply Christ descended; be it to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, to the form of a servant, to death, to the grave, <hi>descendit</hi> would have served for either; but expresly he names the lower parts of the earth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating a lower descent than the former.</p>
                  <p>Now this place so expounded, very well agrees with the Article of our Creed, <hi>He descended into Hell;</hi> which the best Divines have understood not of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or effectual onely, but of a local descent; and therefore I see no reason without any figures, without any allusions, that the place be litterally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; especially since the same Truth is held forth to us in other places; such are, <hi>Thou shalt not leave my soul in hell,</hi> Psal. 16.10. Act. 2.</p>

This exposition seems to me over jejune, and flat; for thus much was contained in the clause before, He was buryed: So that admitting this sense, we have the same thing over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; which cannot be well conceived in so short a sum as the Creed is. For what is it else to say He was buryed and descended into Hell, <hi>i. e.</hi> into the grave, but to profess that he was buryed, and that he was buryed? Neither can any man with just reason affirm, that this clause expounds the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is much more difficult and hard than the former, which is quite and clean contrary to the nature of all exegetical and expository sentences, which ought to be far more clear than the precedent; for how else can they be said to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? This falls not out here, but the clean contrary; for every child can easily conceive what is meant by Buryed, whenas many learned Divines have disputed what is intended by his descent into Hell.

                  <p n="2">2. Three rules are exactly to be observed in the exposition of these words. 1. Distinction of matter. 2. Consequence of order. 3. Propriety of words. Now this exposition is contrary to all three; For it is a superfluous, disorderly, and aenigmatical iteration. Superfluous, for so much was said before; for was not thus much set down to us, when we heard that Christ was dead? for what is it else to dye, then to come under the common state and condition of the dead? 2. Disorderly, for twas no place to mention the power and dominion of death after his Burial. 3. Aenigmatical, obscure, and improper; for it cannot be properly asserted that Christ was under the dominion of death; for his death differed from other mens in three respects. First in the cause; theirs was from sin, so was not his; then in the manner; theirs necessary; his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. Lastly, in the consequent; they dye and rot in the grave; but he saw no corruption; he alone was free among the dead.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third sense is given to this Article, He descended to Hell, by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, farther off the truth than either of the former, and more derogatory to the efficacy of Christs death. So much they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon the Common of Hell, that they have taken out of it three main inclosures, and left onely a fourth part for the Divel and his company. A man would think they had been appointed Surveyors of that place, they can so exactly and cunningly make their draughts, and quarter out the divels kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The lowest peice of it they acknowledge to be that same <hi>Sheol,</hi> or <hi>Hades, infernum,</hi> or <hi>Tartarus,</hi> a prison from which there is no Redemption, over whose gate may be written that golden and best verse of the Poet,

                  <p>Above this they say there's another place, not much easier for torment, but more comfortable for time; 'tis so neer that lower furnace, that the fire thereof flames and streams into every part of this region. Marry the comfort is, that a Dirge or indulgence bought at the Popes hand, or at the worst, some time will free a poor soul from this fearful place. And this is that room calld Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and well it may; for it hath purged more purses of money, than souls from venial sins, as they speak.</p>
                  <p>These two are the main parts; now view the skirts, the buttals and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of this kingdom according to their draught; in their own notion they are <hi>Limbi;</hi> and two they make of them, the old and the new.</p>
                  <p>The old was called <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> a brim or skirt of Hell, where they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the souls of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Patriarchs, Prophets, and holy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God before Christs death and descent remained without comfort or joy, untill Christ by his descending thither, did bring a general Jubilee, and a plenary indulgence for their delivery; but this imaginary Limbus is by their own confession long since broken off and dissolved. No such place in being now.</p>
                  <p>But lest Hell should be without a border, they have now found out a new hem for it; <hi>Limbus puerorum,</hi> and placed in it, all unbaptized Infants, and such as dye onely in the guilt of original sin; a place it is, say they, of darkness,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:200414:139"/> situate next above their supposed Purgatory; yet so as the fire of the lowest Hell reacheth not unto it. Detained poor Infants are there, not burned.</p>
                  <p>For what they affirm of Hell, the Scripture is their wartant; but their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and <hi>Limbus puerorum</hi> it is an imagination, and having onely some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable texts forced by them to speak for it, they impose upon the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when they make it an Article of faith. I cannot now stand to dispute the point; thus much onely I shall say, that <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> those noble Bards sung of it in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> verses; and that it was smothered long in the Church: That in <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> and burns down all things; this hath erected and set up many a Monastry, enriched and encreased <hi>Peters</hi> patrimony; and the profit is so great, that it is held fit to burn till this day.

                     <hi>Ah I am warm, I have seen the fire!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> taken in a right sense, not in theirs, there may be more said. Many fathers, say they, were of this opinion; a number indeed there was, and that considerable, but not universal. All said it not; <hi>Origen, Chrysost. Hierom, Augustine, Ambrose</hi> affirm, that the place was <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom, a place far higher than Hell, saith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> The highest heaven, saith a Jesuite; no verge then or list of the <hi>Romish</hi> Hell. Did they mean no more by their <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> it were tolerable; but in strictness of speech,<note place="margin">Luc. 16.26, 23. Zach. 9.11.</note> that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed it is not agreeable to Gods mercy, that he should take those sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied souls of <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> the Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and deliver them up, to lye in durance for more or less hundreds of years, to suffer <hi>poenam damni,</hi> and groan after their inheritance; especially, when their merits were, as the Pontificians teach, beyond those of ordinary Christians; because when the grounds of their Faith and love were less evident, the fruits of both were more eminent and excellent. This also would be enquired into, whether it doth not more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the power and Grace of a Saviour, to free from pain altogether, than to deliver a poor man from punishment, when he is under it? Certainly, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from danger by prevention, so far, that we never come under it, or in the compass of it, is ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her manner of favour than the deliverance by recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for that keeps us from it; this onely draws us out of the endurance we are already in.</p>
                  <p>Now, why I pray, should not the Patriarchs be as capable of this favour and liberty, as we, who have lived since? Their faith was the same with ours, and their means to escape the same with ours. As we, so they; and as they, so we were all by reason of sin to be sent to the same place; our deliverance is from the same cause, Christ the means to save both.<note place="margin">Revel. 13.8.</note> But his death was effectual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed, he being that Lambe that was slain from the beginning of the world; like the Sun in the firmament, he casts the beams of his Grace back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward, to both ends of the world, being equally a Redeemer unto the faithful as well before as since his comming. And why then should not they be redeemed as fully as we are, when the cause was the same, and the means to obtain the favour the same? what reason is there, but that the same effect should follow? Christ suffered for them, as for us; they as well as we believed and hoped for happiness by his blood; why then must we go to heaven, and they poor souls remain for so long a time in Limbo?</p>
                  <p>Again, what befell to some of them, might happen to others likewise in this case; there being no more reason to admit one to heaven than another.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:200414:140"/> But some were exalted to that place of bliss before our Saviours ascension; so was <hi>Enoch,</hi> so was <hi>Elias; Elias</hi> by their own confession, that I instance not in the thief on the cross, who the day he dyed was in Paradise; and therefore what reason is there to admit any,<note place="margin">Luc. 23.43.</note> and not to admit all? to exclude any, and not to exclude all? If the reason be what they alledge, because Christ had not yet opened the kingdom of heaven; this reason must as well exclude <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> as any of the rest.</p>
                  <p>But this reason is of no force to exclude any of Gods elect from heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ had overcome the sharpness of death;<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> on the <hi>Creed, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 33.</note> for heaven is one thing, and the kingdom of heaven imports another. So that it is one thing to say, that the souls of righteous men deceased were in heaven before our Saviour ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither; another to say, they were in the kingdom of heaven, or Citizens of that Kingdom. And he who denys the souls of the Patriarchs to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Kingdom of Heaven before our Saviours Death and Resurrection, cannot be concluded to grant that they were in Limbo, or in any other region under the earth, or under the stars.</p>
                  <p>I conclude then, that Hell in the Creed, cannot be taken for <hi>Limbus patrum;</hi> and that Christ descended not thither to free the Fathers thence, for they were not there; but in heaven, in Paradise, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom, where they might perhaps be delayed till Christs ascension; yet there they enjoy'd a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral felicity, though not that which they shall enjoy at the consummation of all things,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.2, 3. Heb. 11.40.</note> when body and soul being joyned, shall be taken and seated in that place which Christ is gone before to prepare for them. They without us shall not be perfect.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. These three expossitions then being unapt for the Creed, let us consider, whether we cannot meet with some other more agreeable to the Scripture. Two there are yet behinde; for there are that take Hell Metaphorically; and there are that take it really, and locally.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Those that expound this by a Metaphor, take Hell here not for a place, but the torments of hell; they affirm then that Christ in his soul for seventeen hours together, beginning at his agony in the garden, till he gave up the Ghost, suffered in his soul the pains of hell. Had they meant no more but this, that then our Saviours sorrows were extreme and vehement, sorrows never the like, pains never the like, caused through the wonderful apprehension of Gods wrath lying upon his soul, there had been no impiety in this opinion, though too far yet removed from the true sense of the Creed; but when they assert, <hi>Diros in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima cruciatus danmati &amp; perditi homixis pertulit; Perinde alienatum se à Deo sensit, ac si in suam perniciem conspirasset;</hi> When they say, he must undergo the whole wrath of God, undergo the first and second death, bear all the burden of our sins; This is it which I cannot assent to, in that it differs, being well sifted, but very little from blasphemy. But of this opinion I say no more now, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lately said so much of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. These four senses being all upon so good grounds, thought unapt for this place; I will now deliver, what I judge most suitable to this Article, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ sometime <hi>in Triduo mortis,</hi> the time I define not, did really descend in soul into the place of the damned.</p>
                  <p>This sense is most litteral, natural, and agreeable to the words, no way li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any Tautology, nor repugnant to the Analogy of faith, consorting with the plain words of Scripture, and testimonies of the ancient fathers, and the most judicious Divines of later times. I add, that it seems to me to be the sense of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at the first time of reformation, received and delivered to us in the 37. Article, as appears by these words of Mr. <hi>Noels</hi> Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, <hi>Christum ut corpore in terrae viscera, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a animâ â corpore separatâ ad inferos, ad inferos ipsos descendisse credimus.</hi> We believe, that as Christs body
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:200414:140"/> was laid in the bowels of the earth; so his soul being separated from his body, did descend to the places below, even to those very places; and this Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism is authorised by the publique approbation of our Church. Now the reasons that perswade this exposition, are drawn out of the Scriptures, the Testimonies of Theologues, and the ends of Christs descent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We have both Testaments to speak for it, Old and New;<note place="margin">Psal. 16.11.</note>
                     <hi>David</hi> in the <hi>Psalm</hi> saith it plainly in the person of Christ, <hi>Thou shalt not leave my soul in Hell, neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy one to see corruption;</hi> and that we should not be mistaken, to him Saint <hi>Peter</hi> applies it;<note place="margin">Act. 2.31.</note> which words contain a special prerogative verified in none but in the true <hi>Messias</hi> and Saviour of the world. Saint <hi>Peters</hi> purpose there was to prove him Lord and Christ; thats his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion; his medium to prove this, is drawn from the priviledge of his body and soul; his body as <hi>Davids</hi> did, corrupted not in the Grave,<note place="margin">Vers. 36.</note> and his soul though in Hell, was not left there; each part returns to life with greater glory; the flesh free from corruption, the soul superior to destruction. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore applying this sentence to the resurrection of Christ, doth as it were with his finger point out the places, whence these two parts were to be brought; the soul from Hell, for that could not hold it; and the body from the grave, that it should not corrupt there. Add to this, that if by <hi>Sheol</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we should understand the grave in this place, the phrase would be very improper, since no mans soul can be said to be left in the grave, into which it never comes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I forbear other places of the old Testament, and come to the new; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which this of my Text is one principal. For that reason before alledged, that there is no proportion betwixt the highest heavens, and a grave three foot deep; I add here, that the Scripture is the best intepretor of Scripture; now the lower parts of the earth are in other places of the sacred text put for Hell. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> foretelling the ruin of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> for his pride,<note place="margin">Ezek. 31.14.</note> compares him to a tree; and to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are delivered to death, to the neather parts of the earth with them that go down to the pit, where <hi>Eretz tachtith</hi> hath manifestly the same sense with <hi>Sheol tachath, Esa.</hi> 14.9. hell from beneath or below.<note place="margin">Isa. 14.9.</note> Here the prophet threatens to them two distinct things, Death, and a descent to the neather parts, and gives such sight, speech, affections to them, which those in hell may have and use, but not they in the grave. I spare other places to confirm this, because I hasten, and come to the famous place of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Say not thou in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?</hi>

                     <hi>that is to bring Christ down from above: Or who shall descend</hi> in Abyssum, <hi>into the deep? that is to bring Christ again from the Dead,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle alludes here to <hi>Moses</hi> words, and fits them to Christ; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> speech is of the Law, and his meaning is plain,<note place="margin">Deut. 30.12, 14.</note> that the Jews could not pretend in excuse of their disobedience, the knowledge of Gods will hid from them in heaven, or far removed by sea, that they should say, <hi>Who shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend?</hi> &amp;c. for it was nigh them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This the Apostle applies to the Gospel. The way now to decline death, and obtain life, is not to look to the Law, but to Christ; yea, but where shall we find him? Oh saith the Apostle, Away with all such thoughts. <hi>Ne dicas,</hi> say it not, think it not; ask not, Who shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to heaven to see whether God be reconciled to us through Christ? aske not, Who shall descend to the deep to see whether death be disarmed, and hell gates broken?</p>
                  <p>After Christs descension and ascension, to ask Who shall ascend to procure life? or Who shall descend in <hi>Abyssum</hi> to destroy death for us? savours of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; and through want of faith frustrates what Christ hath purchased for

Now <hi>Abyssus</hi> is never in Scripture used for the grave; it signifies sometimes the depth of the Sea, and bottome of the earth, and is Metaphorically taken for the deep counsels of God, and desperate troubles of men, in the Old Testament: But in the New, only for the bottomless pit, whither the Devils a re afraid to go: as appears by their Petition to Christ, <hi>That they be not commanded to depart</hi>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:200414:141"/> all probability moved Christ to descend. Three ends they assign for it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the souls of Infidels and wicked men there tortured, might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that however their punishments were sharp, yet they were very just. The seed of the woman to break the Serpents head, was promised to them; Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ to come was prophesied; but this they derided, this they mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, as in the dayes of <hi>Noah;</hi> but now they might see all perform'd; he that was to come, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ome; and because they neglected him of whom they had so often heard, their condemnation was just.<note place="margin">Heb. 2.2, 3.</note> This was a real and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sermon; thus the Gospel might be said to be preach'd to the dead. In which he did upbraid to the spirits of obstinate men, what a gracious Saviour they had cast aside.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Satan the great Prince of darkness might see all his power to be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, broken, and utterly ruin'd. He and his servants for an houre had their will on him; betray'd, scourg'd, crucified him,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.53. Mat. 4.3.</note> like an infirme and weak man; This might put him to enquire, <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi> But that now he might see who and what he was, He descended, and broke the Gates of Brass, caused the Keepers of those Gates to tremble, trode under his feet the Serpent, Death, Hell, Triumphed over him in his own Fort, beat him in his own Kingdome; took and bound the strong man,<note place="margin">Luk. 11.22. Col. 2.14, 15.</note> and leads him and all his Troops Captive. I cannot set up a more eminent Trophee for this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, than St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath done; where, after the Bond cancell'd, and nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Cross, he goes on, and sets Christ, as I may so say, <hi>in Sellâ Curuli,</hi> in his Triumphant Chariot, teaching us, <hi>that he despoyled principalities and powers, and made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them.</hi> In which words the Apostle alludes to the manner of Heathen Triumphs. For it was their custome after a Victory, to erect some monument in the place where the Battel was fought and won. This being done, there often follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an open shew, in which the Conquerour was mounted in a triumphal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, and the chief of his enemies being bound and pinioned, were led openly after him.</p>
                  <p>This Battel was fought upon Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> betwixt Christ and the devil. There Christ vanquished him, and erected a Trophee in remembrance that he got the day, and after prosecuted his Victory even to Hell, took there prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, <hi>i. e.</hi> the devil, his angels, hell, death, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-prisoners, spoyled them of their Armour and Weapons, chain'd them and bound them each to other, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3. And this could not choose but give great content to the souls and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of just men deceased before (who, while they lived, believed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Christ) to perceive the work of their Redemption finished, all their enemies vanquished, Death, Hell, and the lord of both conquer'd and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly subdued. Whether therefore we reflect upon the Reprobate, the Devil. or Gods Elect, there be excellent comforts in this one Article. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate are thereby convinced, the Devil destroyed, and the spirits of just men assured that hell never shall have any power to torment them.</p>
                  <p>But could not thus much have been done, had not his soul descended thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Yes, no Question. But if yet it pleased him to descend to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hat dismal place, not to suffer any thing, but there to begin his triumph, we are to admire his love, and congratulate his Victory.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I deliver'd what I conceive of this point, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ in his Soul after his death, descended not only virtually, but locally into <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des;</hi> not to suffer any thing for our Redemption,<note place="margin">Joh. 19.30.</note> there being for that a <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:200414:142"/> upon the Cross, but to triumph over all our spiritual enemies: So that I make not this Article to be the last of his Humiliation and abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but the first step of his exaltation and advancement. If any man shall think otherwise, I condemn him not, as I desire he would not do me. Let the Rule of Charity guide both; That since all confess the truth of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and differ only in the sense, we make no Scisme in Christs seamless coat about it, raise no discord in the Church, but <hi>endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi>

                  <p>You have seen one term of our Saviours motion, as low as low may be. Now will you but look upon the other, you shall see him as high as high may be. In the verse before, it was <hi>On high;</hi> which is somewhat a doubtful word; for any way above or from the earth, is on high. The Apostle then to remove all doubt, that we might know what height, what altitude he meant, expounds it for us. To that pitch he came that he was <gap reason="foreign">

To earth he descended to take flesh, to teach, to suffer, to die, to be buryed: To the lower parts of the earth to triumph. But as yet the whole work of our Redemption was not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; somewhat was to be done in heaven for us; thence he was to be a King, to give Laws and Govern; there as a high Priest, to intercede and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose for us, thence to pour down the gifts of his Spirit, and set Officers in his Church; To earth then he came, and to heaven he went, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. This is an excellent Interpretation of the Apostles Text; and yet there is a second, <hi>He descended and ascended, that he might fill all things;</hi> that is, all things that were written of him. Whatsoever was foretold of him, were but as it were empty things till they were fulfill'd. All were but in promises, in shadows, in types, in figures and prophesies only, which fill not, God he knows.

                     <hi>I am but dust and ashes,</hi> saith <hi>Abraham; I am not worthy of the least of thy mercies,</hi> saith <hi>Jacob; I am thy servant, thy servant, and the sonne of thy hand-maid,</hi> saith <hi>David; I am n t worthy to loose the latchet of thy shooe,</hi> saith <hi>John; Not worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> saith the Prodigal; <hi>Not worthy that thou should'st come under my roof,</hi> saith the Centurion; <hi>A sinful man,</hi> saith St. <hi>Peter; Not worthy to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Apostle,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Thus humble these best servants of God were in the presence of their Lord.</p>
                  <p>And how ready every one of these were to serve each other in love, is as evident.<note place="margin">Gen. 13.8, 9, 10 Gen. 33.3, 14, 15. Psa. 53.13. Isa. 41.8. Rom. 4.16. Isa. 44.1, 2. Psa. 78.71. Mat. 3.15. Mat. 8.10. Gal. 2.7, 9. Act. 9.15.</note>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> is humble, even to <hi>Lot</hi> his Nephew: <hi>Jacob</hi> speaks out of the dust to his Brother: <hi>David</hi> puts on Sackcloth for his enemies: I forbear more examples, This was their descent before God, to men; little they were in their own eyes; yet none greater in the eyes of God than these. For <hi>Abraham</hi> from his dust and ashes, is raised to be the friend of God, to be the father of the faithful. <hi>Jacob</hi> to be his servant: <hi>David</hi> from the sheep-fold to feed his people: The <hi>Baptist</hi> unworthy to unty his shooe, to pour water on his head: The Centurion a man of greater faith than any in <hi>Israel; Peter</hi> from his boat, to be one of the chief of the Apostles; and <hi>Paul,</hi> notwithstanding his unworthiness, a chosen Vessel.</p>
                  <p>Behold what humility can do! raise from the dust, raise from the flock, raise from the lowest condition to the highest favor. I know not any thing in the world that riseth to perfection, but it is at first humbled: A descent there is, before there be an ascent. Seeds are laid low in the earth, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled yet lower in the root, before you see them in their Ascendent, flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their green, mounted on their stalks or Trunks, spreading in their boughs, and loaded with their ears or fruits: Men again are crying in their Cradles, vested in their Clouts and Coats, before they arrive at the strength of men; In their <hi>A B C,</hi> before they can offer at any perfection of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The like is to be found in all other things. They are in their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, in their <hi>fieri,</hi> in their powers only, which is a kind of humiliation and descent, before they get up, grow strong, mature, and come to full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. No form is introduced, but a privation precedes.</p>
                  <p>And thus it must be in Christianity; perfection we are to aim at; to rise to that height to be loaden with fruits; but this will never be, except the seeds be sown in humility.<note place="margin">Jam. 4.6.</note>
                     <hi>For God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.</hi> In which vertue the more we root, the faster we stand, and the taller and more fruitful we are like to be.<note place="margin">Ez. 9.4.</note> In <hi>Ezekiel</hi> those who were saved, were marked with the letter <hi>Tau</hi> in their foreheads. That is the true mark of humility, true in the letter, for it is in the foot, the last, the lowest of the Hebrew Alphabet; and true again in the type, for it bears the emblem of the Cross, which was the last and lowest step of our Saviours humiliation while he liv'd.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.8.</note>

For who yet ever saw a babe in his cradle, in his first clouts proud? poor innocent, he knows not what it means: And what time, trow you, will those sons of pride come to the measure of the first age in Christ? can they ever hope to come to the top of the ladder, who are not yet upon the first round?</p>

                     <hi>and power to take it again:</hi> and therefore he bade the Jews, <hi>Destroy, &amp;c.</hi> but know yet, that I will raise it.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture I know speaks sometimes passively, He is raised; sometimes actively, He rose.

                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.4.</note> Christ was an extraordinary person, composed of two Natures, God and Man, and therefore he did participate of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both.

His Deity was never parted from his Humanity, no not when his body lay breathless in the grave. The body is lay'd in the grave, the soul is resigned; the God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally united to them both without any possibility of divorce.

                     <hi>and rose again, for thou Lord makest we dwell in safety.</hi> When he was to dye, no man took his life from him, <hi>for he gave up the ghost,</hi>

As the Passion of Christ was, as I may so say, the sleep of his Deity, so also the death of Christ was the sleep of his Humanity.</p>
                  <p>Two priviledges belong to sleepers. One is Incorruption; The other is hope of Resuscitation, In those that sleep, though <hi>Morpheus</hi> binds all the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and restrains their operations, yet in sleep there is an immunity from corruption. For when this sister of death is pleased to unloose her bonds, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sence and part is in the self same integrity, if not better than what it was when we lay down. Thus was it with our Saviour; he lay'd himself down to rest in his grave indeed,<note place="margin">Psal. 88.5.</note>
                     <hi>but he was free among the dead;</hi> he had a liberty that never any dead man had besides himself. For whereas other dead bodies are resolv'd into dust, <hi>God would not suffer his holy one to see corruption.</hi> He
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:200414:144"/> rose as entire from the bed of his grave as when he lay down: Otherwise death should have had dominion in part over him.</p>
                  <p>The second priviledge is Resuscitation. Men go to bed with a purpose to rise again; so did our Saviour go to his grave, not to lye there beyond a set time, but when he had sweetned and perfumed that bed for us, to take his leave, and return to life. For</p>

                  <p>And that Christ is again risen from the dead, there is evidence enough to perswade any man, except him who is possest with obstinacy, and the spirit of conrradiction. The books are open; and if ether the Praedictions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the witness of Angels, his own Apparitions, the opening of the graves after he rose, the malicious tales of his very enemies, the testimonies of many men and women, the valour and constancy of those who dyed for the witness of it, the multitude of those who quickly embraced and believed it will satisfie, he that runs may read and hear enough to confirm him in this truth. <hi>Et quid testium satis, si non hoc satis?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> And if this cloud of witnesses be not enough, men deserve to be under a cloud of error still.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, what evident Praedictions are there of our Saviours resurrection, both by others, and himself! His holy Ptophets foretold it, <hi>Job</hi> was assured of it;<note place="margin">Job. 19.15. Psal. 16.10.</note>
                     <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth. David</hi> saith it plainly, <hi>Thou shalt not leave my soul in hell, neither shalt thou suffer thy holy One to see corruption. Isaiah</hi> foretelleth it, <hi>He was taken from prison, and from judgement. Jonah</hi> was a Type of it; and the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> confidently avoucheth it;<note place="margin">Isa. 53.8.

                     <hi>He shall quicken us again after two dayes, in the third he shall raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much was promised and hoped for by the Prophets before his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the flesh, and while he lived he averred as much. How often did he tell his Disciples that he should go to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> be crucified;<note place="margin">Matt. 20.19.</note> and that he would rise again the third day? he plainly did affirm to the faces of his greatest enemies, that if they destroyed, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But taking no longer to make good his promise then three dayes, 'tis evident he meant to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; for otherwise the fraud would soon have been detected. And it seems that his intentions and promises were well enough known, not only to his friends, but even to the Jews his enemies.<note place="margin">Matth. 27.63.</note> Why is it else that they presse <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> and put him in mind of his words? <hi>Sir, we remember that this deceiver,</hi> (so they blasphemed) <hi>said, while he was yet alive, after three dayes I will rise again;</hi> they could you see, call it to mind and remember it. <hi>Et ut praedix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, sic revixit;</hi> he gave warning that it should be so, and he fulfilled it.

                  <p>Farther yet, their sight was a position well beseeming the resurrection; for they were sate to take their rest, as we ordinarily say, Sit down and rest: Such is a grave now become to Gods servants, a place of rest; of rest, not from our labours only,<note place="margin">Psal. 16.9.</note> so the beasts rest when they dye; but as the Psalmist, <hi>a rest in hope;</hi> hope of rising again to the members, by vertue of the head, whom the Angel said was risen,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.11.</note> and hope to enter into the rest above, <hi>And sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, the Angels order in sitting is not without a Mystery, one at the head, the other at the feet; Such a thing there will be at the resurrection of the just; difference of places,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.33. 1 Cor. 15.41, 42.</note> difference of glory then, some set on the right hand, and some on the left in his kingdom; All shall have glory enough, though not all an equal degree of glory.</p>

Who will ever believe, that a man forsaken of life, and able to do nothing, should be able to hinder, or alter the actions of living and active men? And yet thus it fell out, By the testimonies of those poor men bearing witness to the world, that Christ was risen; the adulterer left his adulteries, the murtherer his cruelties;<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> nay, which is beyond all reason, the feigned gods of those times forsook their Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Hear, O you despisers, and wonder! How could the ashes of a dead man ever prevail so much with the living, that upon the confidence of life therein contained, they should willingly forego wife, children, goods, good name, and life it self, with such alacrity and magnanimity, that their enemies held it for a ruled and resolved case? there is no Christian living that feareth death. This strange alteration in the world, these silly men could not have effected, had their witness been any way loose or controlable; for force they had none to do it.

                  <p>And the success of this their declaration, is an evident argrment of the Truth, that without any humane motives (for what could they promise, or did they, except poverty, scorn, contempt, afflictions) whole Nations quickly were of their judgement.

                     </q> And therefore <hi>Pilate</hi> the Governor considering what was done, and that it was unlikely that if the body were stollen, it should be taken away without the privity of the guard, calls the souldiers to him, and understood by them the whole Truth.

What power ever before this time, or since, hath caused those walls of earth to gape, and split, and redeliver many of her dead at one time? Were there no other argument to prove that Christ was risen, then the reuniting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of these good souls to their cold deaded bodies; yet this one were enough, for the witnesses were holy, and many, Saints, and a multitude of Saints. If <hi>Dives</hi> thought a Sermon preached by the mouth but of one from the dead, were more effectual for the conversion of his five brethren to repentance,<note place="margin">Luc. 16.30.</note> then all the perswasions of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets: how powerful then should be the tongue of Saints, of many Saints, of many Saints arising at once from the Dead be to perswade men, that Christ is risen?</p>
                  <p>To collect all, If Angels, men, women, strangers, disciples, frieads, foes, a whole cloud of witnesses: if the emptying of the sepulcher, and leaving the linnen cloths; if the amazement of the watch, subornation of the high Priests and Elders; if the letter of <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Tiberius;</hi> if the sending down of the Holy Ghost; if the gifts then and after given; if the miracles wrought in Christs name; if the suddain and miraculous conversion of the world; if preaching, living, and dying in that belief be enough to beget credit: <hi>Then Christ is risen from the dead, and now he dyeth no more; death hath no more domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over him;</hi>

                  <p>Some man may perchance marveil why I have been so punctual to prove an Article of Faith? Before I be condemned, hear my Apology. First, I have done in it respect of Christs enemies that thereby the mouths of all contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors might be stopt; and there can be no exception taken against this relation, which will not be as strong to prejudice any Narrative of any matter of fact though never so manifest, which a man hath not seen with his own eyes; to which let a man give way, and a man may almost deny any thing, but the Sun shines. Next, I have taken this pains for the comfort of Christians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause upon the resurrection of Christ depends our chief happiness. For if Christ be not risen,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.17.</note> our faith is vain, we are yet in our sin.</p>
                  <p>This is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his answer to <hi>Agrippa</hi> called the hope of the fathers,<note place="margin">Act. 26.6. Rev. 14.12. 1 Cor. 15.14. Psal. 58.5.</note> and I may say as properly it is the patience and faith of the Saints; without this our preaching is vain; If Christ be not risen, pull down Temples, destroy your Churches, burn the writings of the Prophets and Apostles, stop your ears at the voice of the charmer, charm he never so wisely; praise the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more then the dead in the Lord; and practice that <hi>Epicurean</hi> lesson, <hi>Let us eat and drink for to morrow we shall dye:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.32.</note> For as in every action the vertue that moveth the Agent to undertake it, is the hope of good to come; <hi>Virtus agendi spes futuri:</hi> He that soweth, soweth to reap; and he that fights, fights for victory. So take the hope of the resurrection (which depends upon this of Christs) and all the conscience and care of godliness will fall to the ground. That therefore your faith should be stronger, your hope better assured, and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:200414:147"/> your alacrity in the way of godliness more quick and spriteful and better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, I have laid this for a foundation, that Christ is risen, and proved it I hope very evidently and sufficiently.</p>
                  <p>The benefits you reap thereby, are so many, and so important, that I will take the next hour to recount them; till then I entreat you,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. ult.</note> that you would comfort one another with these words, that you would be <hi>stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,</hi>

What's of a more fragrant smell then the clusters of <hi>Cypress?

His ignominious passion em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered with all scornes and pains that malice could invent, was like a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Myrrh; but his resurrection falling at a season when every flower and tree puts forth, is as a handful of Cypress; an Act which sends forth a more pleasing sent then the most odoriferous sweet.</p>
               <p>Of these two, Myrrh and Cypress, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath here made a Christian posie. That he was delivered; there's Myrrh for you; That he was raised, there's Cypress. You shall do very well to make use of both; For, for your sakes he underwent and took down the Myrrh, and for your sakes again it was that he shot up as a green Cypress; He dyed for us, he rose for us; He was delivered for our sins; he rose again for our justification.</p>

                  <p>Benefits that concern another, little affect us; but when we once become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested in the profit, then we begin with a greedy ear to hearken after them. If then your attentions and hearts may be won; here's enough to make you atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and affectionate. His was the pains, He dyed; your's are the gains, 'twas for your offences. His was the Resurrection, yours the benefit; 'twas for your justification. How kinde hath the God of heaven been to us poor men, that whatsoever his son did or suffered it must be done for us!</p>
                  <p>As the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> had foretold, so it must be, <hi>To you a Son is given, and to you a child is born;</hi> he might have added, for you this child must dye,<note place="margin">Isa. 9.6.</note> for
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:200414:148"/> you this Son will arise; since it is certain, that he wholly laid himself out for our use.</p>
                  <p>For himself he was not born, he dyed not; for he that was born of his Father before all times,<note place="margin">Mic. 5.2.</note> could not add any thing to his honor by being born of a poor Virgin; And sure I am that such a death could not be to his reputation. And for the Angels who knew his Majesty and greatness, they had no desire to see him less; little he was for our sakes onely, because we alone stood in need of him; for us then he was born, for us he lived; he went about all his life time to do good to such as were no better then we are:<note place="margin">Act. 10.38.</note> For our offences he dyed; for our sins he suffered, and for our justification he rose again; all was for our benefit and advantage.</p>
                  <p>For what could he by any of these Acts gain to himself more then he had? could he be greater then he was, who was the Son of God? could he be more honoured then he was,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.16. Rev. 21.24.</note> before whose footstool all Kings of the earth throw down their crowns? If a stable, if hunger and thirst, if ignominy, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, the cross, death, and a grave could honor him, then from these he might receive access of glory, for these he underwent to the full. The good in all these was ours, not his; that we might be honoured, that we might be bettered, we saved, we discharged, he would undergo all these and Dye. After which the honour befell him to arise; and yet that neither he would appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to himself; content he was, that we also should have a share in the Benefit.</p>

                     <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> in his sums hath set down five reasons why it was necessary that Christ should arise from the grave. The</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Ad commendationem divinae justitiae,</hi> To set forth and commend unto us Gods righteous dealing. For it is a peculiar of divine justice to raise those, who are unjustly depressed; with men it is too often otherwise; if any raised, it must not be of all other reasons for that he was oppressed or crushed; but with God it is otherwise;<note place="margin">Psal. 113.7, 8.</note> he raiseth the poor out of the dust, where and when every foot is apt to trample upon them; he that brings light out of darkness, exalts the humble, just, and innocent man, and sets him with the Princes, even with the Princes of his people; it was reasonable then, that he who was thus unjustly humbled, should be again exalted; that he who was causelesly brought so low, should again be raised and set on high. The master builders refused him,<note place="margin">Act. 4.11. 1 Pet. 2.7.</note> and cast him aside as an useless stone, and unfit for any place in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and God in justice called for him again, and made him the head of the corner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another reason why he rose, was, <hi>ad fidei nostrae instructionem,</hi> To build up our faith; for by the resurrection of our Saviour our Faith is much strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confirmed; In that he arose from the grave, and delivered himself from the sorrows of death, assured we are of his divine power. Thus saith the Apostle, He was declared to be the Son of God, by his resurrection from the dead,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 'Twas a part of the definition by which he might be known to be so. All he had done else, some or other of the Prophets now and then had done the like; given signs even from heaven, yea even raised the dead. But raise himself being dead, get forth of the heart of the earth, when once he was in it, that exceeded a Prophets power; ne're a Patriarch or Prophet o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:200414:148"/> them all could do that; So then that by this power he overcame the tyranny of death, it declared him undoubtedly, and may settle us in our belief, that he is the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>While he lay in the grave, how weak was the faith even of his own disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples! They, when they saw him laid in, and sealed up in the monument, a stone rolled over him, and a watch set upon him, began to doubt, whether that were he who was to redeem Israel. To say nothing of their faith, their very hope was in a swoon; <hi>sperabamus</hi> say they,<note place="margin">Luc. 24.21.</note> we were in a good hope while he lived, but now we can hope very little from him. No better means than to revive their forlorn hope, and free them from despair than that he be up again. Upon it <hi>Mary</hi> calls him <hi>Rabboni;</hi> upon this <hi>Thomas</hi> acknowledgeth him,<note place="margin">Joh. 20.16, 28.</note>
                     <hi>My Lord and my God;</hi> upon this they which were faithless, became faithful, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed him, confessed him, preached him, dyed for him; No better means then to confirm us in the faith, than that Christ is risen.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third is, <hi>ad spei nostra sublevationem,</hi> That we should live in hope, dye in hope, and rest in hope; that as Christ rose again, so our bodies, though turned to dust, should again arise from those dusty beds;<note place="margin">Zach. 9.11.</note> so the resurrection of Christ speaks comfort to all the prisoners of Hope, that the members shall be in no worse condition than the head, because he rose in body, and is alive; therefore every part of him shall get up and live also. And of this <hi>medium Job</hi> serves himself, and strongly infers his conclusion, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth;</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. The fourth reason why our Saviour arose, is here assigned by Saint <hi>Paul; It is for our justification:</hi> In reading the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies vary; for some read it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; the difference of the words is this; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is that vertue which indeed comprehends in it all vertues, a habit of justice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in us, which we in Divinity call sanctification, or rather sanctity and holiness. If then the Apostles word were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the sense is, that Christ rose, that he might be either the Efficient cause, or the type and example to us to rise from sin, as he rose from the grave; and to have his holiness, and purity inherent in us; which is certainly true, as in the close I shall make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you.</p>
                  <p>The other, and more usual word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which <hi>Beza</hi> conceives should be rendred rather <hi>justificamen,</hi> or <hi>justificamentum,</hi> and is opposed to <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or condemnation, or <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is a legal word, and signifies the pleading of a mans own cause before a Tribunal, when he puts in what may make for his defence. The meaning then of the Apostle may be this, that Christ being risen from the dead, hath put into every mans mouth that rose in him, what he shall be able to say in justification of himself, when he shall appear at the bar of God. Give me leave to prosecute the Metaphor, that from the proceeding in a Court, you may with comfort understand this necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point. In every Session you know there are accusers, an Enditement, a Judge, whose office it is to absolve or condemne: It is so here.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Accusers here be, the Divel, who as by name,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.10.</note> so in nature is the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of the brethren; our own conscience, which is instead of a thousand wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. The Sun and Moon in whose presence we have committed our sins; the creatures which we have inordinately abused, his servants whose voice we have not heard, our brethren whom we have oppressed, and our companions with whom we have too wantonly lived.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:200414:149"/>2. The inditement will be laid for impiety, infidelity, irreligion, perjury, theft, adultery, oppression; in a word for all the enomities we have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all acts of piety or charity omitted. To all which I know not any man can plead Not guilty; yet the just Judge will be content to hear <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that we put in our plea; which can be no other then this, Christ rose for our justification. This, no man can do with a good conscience, but he who is a penitent,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1. Mat. 5.6.</note> believing sinner; he who lives not after the flesh, but after the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. He who hungers nor after righteousness, the righteousness of Christ to be imputed to him, by which he may be discharged and acquitted from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and after the righteousness of Christ inherent in him, by which he can say he is freed from the dominion of sin; so that though sin dwelt, yet it never reigned,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.20. &amp; 6.12.</note> or if any time, yet very unwillingly in his mortal body.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which remaines, is, we expect the sentence of the Judge; heavy this would be, if according to our merit, no other than the sentence of death; for we have deserved no less. But behold, stand amazed and wonder, in stead of condemning, he is pleased to admit of the plea of these poor penitent and believing sinners, justifie them, and declare them for his Sons sake inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent persons.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth he this by his absolute power, as a King by his royal prerogative pardons an offendor; but manifests to the world that he is satisfied for the wrong, and upon that satisfaction doth acquit them. So that justification is not a work of power, but a work of mercy and justice; of justice in that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God will have an infinite punishment suffered either by us or our Surety, proportionable to the infinity of the offence; of mercy in that he did and doth receive the punishment of another to free us.</p>
                  <p>Two things then there are which concur in this work of our justification; one on Gods behalf, and the other on our part.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which God doth, is called imputation of Christs justice to the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied person, which justice ariseth from the obedience of his Son, Active and Passive. For as it is in a marriage where some noble man espouseth a woman of low degree, the honors and wealth of the husband are so far imparted to the wife, that her means and poverty are no more regarded, but all her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands riches and Titles are attributted to her: So in this case it falls out, that our faults and punishments being by God imputed to his Son, we are acquitted from them; and all his Sons righteousness being imputed to us, we for the merit thereof appear righteous in his sight; <hi>He that knew no sin, he was made sin for us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note>
                     <hi>that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now upon this imputation of Christs righteousness, there follow three ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable benefits to a Christian soul; redemption from sin, remission from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, Reconciliation to God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Grace is given, whereby a man is freed from the domineering power of sin. He that is not within the compass of the Covenant, is a captive of sin; a slave and drudge to sin,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 21.20. Rom. 13.14.</note> he sells himself to work iniquity, and obeys it in the lusts thereof; held he is in such a bond of captivity, that he shall not return to good; and bound with such fetters of servitude, that he shall not cease from evil. Now when he becomes a justified person, he is freed from this captivity, slavery, and drudgery, <hi>For the Law of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, hath freed me from the law of sin and death.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> Christ erects his throne in his heart, and enables to mortifie and destroy every enormous and grievous sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A pardon is also given him, whereby he is absolved from punishment; sin and pain are Relatives, they answer one to another, as face to face in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;<note place="margin">Prov. 27.19.</note> he that is guilty of the breach of Gods law, is subject to the punishment threatned for the breach of that law, which is all kind of death. Now the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:200414:149"/> Apostle told us in the former place, <hi>that the Law of the Spirit frees us from the Law,</hi> that is, the force and power of Death.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> So then a justified person is acquitted from the power of both, <hi>à potestate dominandi, &amp; damnandi.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> Sin shall neither domineer over him, nor be able to condemn him; <hi>For there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And the third mercy is, that God is pacified and reconciled to him; not only remits what is past, but becomes a friend. By the blood of Christ his peace is made. <hi>For the chastisement of our peace was upon him.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now the happy condition of those who are justified by the imputation of Christs righteousness! Freed they are from the tyranny of sin,<note place="margin">Isa. 53.5.</note> absolv'd from the rigour of punishment, and reconciled to the favor and love of God: Of which, that he might assure us, he rose from the grave. For had he lien there still, we could never have been confident, than he had procur'd grace or pardon for us, or wrought our peace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What God in mercy does for us we see; and to whom it is done we behold. Sinners they are who are thus justified. But that you be not presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, they are not all sinners pelimell, who are set at liberty, pardoned, and accepted to favour; somewhat also is required on our part, before we be admitted into the list and number of the justified. 'Twas a virulent and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious aspersion that <hi>Celsus</hi> laid upon our Saviour, that he call'd all sinners to come unto him, Publicans, Harlots, to all he gave welcome and pardon: Which also is as maliciously by <hi>Zosymus</hi> objected to <hi>Constantine,</hi> as the cause of his conversion to Christianity. From which he was apt to conclude,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zosymus.</hi> lib. 2.</note> that Christs Church was like the <hi>Asylum</hi> set up by <hi>Romulus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plutarch. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul.</note> being a Sanctuary for all comers. To which <hi>Origen</hi> return'd this answer, that there is a double invitation; One of the Thief, the other of the Physician: The Thief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites to get companions; the Physician Patients; the Thief to debauch the innocent; the Physician to cure the diseased, to recover the relapsed: The former to continue and confirm them in their lewd courses: The latter to purge out, and reform their impurities. This, this is the design of Christ. For God justifies none as sinners, but as sinners that are fitted and prepar'd for justification, that is, penitent and believing sinners. So that these two are both necessary <hi>in justificato,</hi> in him who desires to be justified, Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>The Gospel is the great power of God to salvation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.16. Mark 16.16.</note> but with this limitation and caution, <hi>to every believer. For he that believeth only shall be saved.</hi> God is pleased to propose and offer to us his Son in the Gospel, upon which there must follow an acceptation and reception of this his free of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, without which this work cannot be perfect and consummate; The merit of Christ is of no more power than physick, though never so precious, not applied, or not taken down. Now Faith is the hand that applies it. It was so in <hi>Ahraham,</hi> who is therefore call'd the <hi>Father of the faithful.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4.3, 12. Act. 6.8. Act. 8.37. Act. 10.45. Joh. 1.12.</note>
                     <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham believ'd, and that was counted to him for righteousnesse;</hi> so with <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, who was full of faith;</hi> so with the <hi>Eunuch;</hi> so with <hi>Cornelius;</hi> so, in a word, with all. <hi>For so many as received him,</hi> that is, by faith, <hi>to them he gave power to become the Sons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Faith how weak soever, if true, is said to justifie in a double sense; either in Relation, or Opposition.</p>

For take it as a quality, a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, a habit infused into the heart by the holy Spirit, and so it justifies not; for that were to make our Faith our Christ. But reflect upon faith in another notion, as it hath for its object Christ Jesus, and layes hold on his whole ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and applies it; and so faith may be very properly said to justifie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the object which it apprehends doth justifie.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:200414:150"/>2. Or again, in another sense faith is said to justifie, that is <hi>oppositè,</hi> as it is opposed to good works, because it excludes from <hi>Justification,</hi> the works of the Moral Law.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.28.</note> Which, though vertues of very high esteem, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and requisite in the eyes of God and man (since without them our faith lives not) yet being polluted and defective,<note place="margin">Jam. 2.17.</note> they may not be pleaded <hi>in foro justitiae,</hi> in the High Court of Justice. <hi>In foro novae obedientiae,</hi> In the Chancery, set up for examination of works of new obedience, they may pass, and receive a candid Interpretation; but in the Upper Bench of strict Justice, where every mans life and actions must be tryed by the exact Letter of the Law, all works, whether done by the power of Nature, or help of Grace, will fall short of that the Law requires, and consequently, nor they shall be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified for exactly good, nor any man justified for them.</p>
                  <p>That which in this Court must justifie, must be the sole merit of Christ; of which he alone can be a partaker, who is a believer; so saith the Apostle, <hi>By him every one that believeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 13.39.</note>
                     <hi>shall be justified.</hi> Faith then is the first condition that is required in a justifiable person.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The other condition required in the man, without which no pardon, no remission can be had, is repentance, and godly sorrow. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Repentance, <hi>non attingit effective remissionem,</hi> doth not effectually procure Remission,<note place="margin">Psa. 22.14.</note> yet is it <hi>removens prohibens,</hi> and takes away all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of pardon. It takes away stubbornness, and makes the heart like wax, fit to receive an impression.<note place="margin">2 Reg. 22.19. 2 Chron. 32, 26 Psa. 73.1. Psa. 101.2.</note> It removes pride, <hi>and makes the heart an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart:</hi> It takes away hardness, <hi>and makes the heart a soft and a tender heart:</hi> It washeth off pollution, <hi>and makes the heart clean:</hi> It removes hypocrisie, <hi>and makes the heart sincere and honest.</hi> So that by it the heart being put in a new frame, made dutyful, lowly, broken, tender, clean, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and honest, the man may come with some boldness to the Throne of Grace, and humbly entreat that he may be found in the number of those who shall receive this pardon of Grace.</p>
                  <p>This is the Method that Christ hath taught us to preach, and you to learn by;<note place="margin">Luk. 24.47.</note>
                     <hi>Go and preach Repentance and Remission of sinne:</hi> Observe, <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> first, and <hi>Remission of sinne</hi> after. This is the Summe of that Text upon which our Saviour first preach'd. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the Gospel;</hi> but to whom? <hi>to the poore; he hath sent me to heale the broken-hearted,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 4.18, 19.</note>
                     <hi>to preach deliverance to the captives, recovering of sight to the blinde, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Repentance is to be considered as an Act, or as a State. As an Act, and so it must in the nature of the thing go before justification.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> pract. Catech.</note> As a state, so it must follow; it being the leading a new, holy, and gracious life, the improving the grace which God gives, and persevering, and dying in it.</p>
                  <p>The order then which God hath taken to save a poor sinner, is this. First God gives his Son to die and satisfie for him: In that death he strikes up a Covenant with him: According to this Covenant he calls for Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: If he hear this call, repents, and believes, God justifies him. He gives him more grace upon the improvement of the Talent given to him: Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon his perseverance gives him, as to a faithful servant, a Crown of Glory.</p>
                  <p>But if this Covenant be striken with us in his death, and we justified by his Death and Passion, how is it here attributed to his Resurrection? <hi>He rose,</hi> saith our Apostle, <hi>for our justification;</hi> the Apostle rather should have said He dyed for our justification.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, that in the Passion and Death of Christ was contain'd the Ransom and Merit: but in the Resurrection, the evidence and Declaration,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:200414:150"/> that we were freed and justified. For whereas Christ died, he died for our sins; of which had there been the least unsatisfied, death would have kept him in his grave still; whereas therefore he rose from thence, it is more than manifest, that he made so full a satisfaction for them all, that death was able to hold him no longer in prison.</p>
                  <p>We willingly therefore divide the work of our Redemption betwixt the Passion and Resurrection of our Saviour. We attribute to his Death the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the debt both of sinne and punishment: But the first means of the application of it to his Resurrection; for by it we are proclaimed to stand <hi>recti in curiâ,</hi> held for freed men, and innocent persons: As therefore the Superscription of his Cross might have been, <hi>O death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.54, 55</note>
                     <hi>I will be thy death!</hi> so also the Epitaph on his Tomb might have been, <hi>Death is swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in victory.</hi> For however <hi>virtualis Triumphus &amp; meriti,</hi> the virtual and meritorious Triumph over Death, was upon the Cross, and in the death of our Saviour; yet this Triumph was acted, and the Solemnity thereof kept on the day of his <hi>Resurrection.</hi> Upon the Cross he did Triumph over death as <hi>in Campo Ʋictoriae,</hi> in the field where the battel was fought and won, as I said before; but on the day he rose, he celebrated it <hi>in Sella Curuli &amp; Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphali,</hi> in his Triumphal Chariot, when he return'd to life, and led Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity Captive.</p>
                  <p>This one point of Christian Religion,<note place="margin">Use.</note> is the Anchor upon which our souls must rest in all the tempests of despaire.<note place="margin">Gen. 8.9.</note> As <hi>the Dove sent forth by Noah when the waters overran the earth, found no rest for the sole of her foot till she returned againe to the Ark:</hi> So the soul of man, when the deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a guilty conscience shall encompass him, shall find nothing to rest on, nothing to secure him, till he come to this Ark of safety, to know how he may be justified.</p>
                  <p>Every man must come to his bed of death, from thence to his grave; far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet, from his grave to judgement. Here or there he must look to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded for his original, for his actual sinnes: where he shall have so many Articles preferr'd against him as he hath committed offences of infirmity, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, negligence, malice, or omitted duties of piety or charity. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves him then to think, when God shall call, what he will answer;<note place="margin">Job 31.14. Hab. 2.1.</note> how he may be acquitted, how absolv'd at that Bar. Who is it that can justifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by the rigorous Rule of the Law? who is it that can cleanse his heart, or wash his hands from sin? That then which must assure our hearts before God, is not the righteousness of the Law, but the righteousness which is by faith.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:200414:151"/> so long as Christ who is our Head and Husband, is alive. If he plead far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we never fulfill'd the Law, and consequently we have no right to Eternal life, the reply is easie, by granting all that is objected, and that our hope of, and our Title to Eternal life depends not now upon our own perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, but upon the obedience of Christ, who hath fulfill'd the Law for us: In the duties of which, if we have faln short, our answer must be, That we have been overborne by Satans temptations, and that therefore our failings shall be surely imputed to him, and set upon his score at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Be it that he dayly and hourly molest and vex the conscience with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probration of manifold corruptions and imperfections, yet if our heart can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply sincerely, that we have had God alwayes before us, that we have stood in aw, and fear'd to offend, that we dayly lament these wants and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, fixing all our hope in the merits of Christ, all our defects will be cover'd by his obedience.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, If at the hour of death, the fear and apprehension of the just judgement, anger, and wrath of God shall affright, terrifie, and appale our poor, sinful, and guilty soul, Answer we may, that Christ hath undergone this wrath for us, he was in an agony, and brought to this furnace for our sakes; which suffe ing of his we may justly place betwixt the fierce wrath of God, and our dismay'd consciences; and quietly rest in the confidence of it, infold, and wrap up our souls in it, and so present them to our God.</p>

                  <p>It is an error certainly, that runs in most mens heads, that when they hear of the Resurrection, they conceive of it only as a thing to come; not to take place till the latter day; to concern the body, and not the soul: whereas the Scriptures speak otherwise.<note place="margin">Rev. 20.6.</note> In them we meet with a first Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as well as a second; and happiness assign'd to him who hath his part in the first. For to speak truly, this is but the Key of the other; and Christs <hi>resurge</hi> hath its proper efficacy and vertue upon us when we thus rise; and we never shall find true comfort in that, till we rise first by this. No glory is to be expected without grace. <hi>An unclean thing cannot enter heaven;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 21.27.</note> and such are all men, till they rise from sin.

                  <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Speed.</hi> He lay no longer in the grave than needs must, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened his Resurrection: As he then rose the third day from the grave,<note place="margin">Joh. 20.1.</note> and in the dawning of that day, so we immediately and early rise to a new life. Well it were we would make it this mornings work, and not defer it an hour longer; for <hi>plus valet hora fervens, quam mensis tepens,</hi> one hours heat and fervency in this work, will do more than a whole months lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Yet if you put it off for this hour, delay it not till another day. For then the day of Resurrection will be past, and God knows whether you shall ever see another <hi>Easter.</hi> Let this day then be your Passeover, I mean, your <hi>Transitus,</hi> or day of passage from sin; <hi>Behold now is the day,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.2.</note> therefore take the time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Next imitate him in the <hi>Act;</hi> he did it but once: So also do you this work so perfectly, that it be but once done. Resurrection of other Saints can be no true pattern for this. They rose, and went to their graves again, and therefore must have a second Resurrection. The <hi>Shunamites</hi> son, <hi>Jairus</hi> daughter, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> rose to life, but they dyed, and returned againe to that place whence they came: So did not Christ, he dyed no more, return'd to the earth no more, that he should need a second rising, and left also all the Ornaments of a dead man,<note place="margin">Joh. 20.6, 2.</note> the Napkins and linnen cloths in his grave behinde him. Thus we should do, dye to sinne, and live to God; dye and live once for all. Being once up, continue we should in a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified estate.</p>
                  <p>But alas, with us it is not so; we play fast and loose with God; we dye and live, and live and dye, as oft as sin commands; which shews that our Resurrection is rather like that of <hi>Lazarus</hi> (than Christs) <hi>who came from the grave fast bound hand and foot;</hi> and so we rise from our old sins,<note place="margin">Joh. 11.44.</note> with our bonds and grave-cloaths about us still.</p>
                  <p>Grace lifts up the eye, looks up a little, and giveth some signes of life
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:200414:152"/> against a good time, such as this. But after a day or two, if not before, comes sin and layes his command upon us, bids us go, and we go; come, and we come;<note place="margin">Mat. 8.9.</note> do this, and we do it; The Centurions servants were not more ready at his nod, than we are obedient when this great Commander speaks; for we follow him <hi>as a fool to the Stocks.</hi>

Get you must out of this Tyrants clutches, and make an end of these scandalous recidivations. Dye you ought once to sin, as Christ died but once; and rise once to newness of life, and continue alive ever after, as Christ did.</p>
                  <p>Now whether you do this or no, you shall know by these evident signs; breath, warmth, and motion; for as these are evidences of a natural, so will they be of a spiritual life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What is it then you breath after? with what is your mind warm'd? If you breath in nothing but the foggy vapours that arise from the earth, and nothing can warm your heart except a wedge of gold, you are in your grave still: whereas if you have a heavenly mind,<note place="margin">Col. 3.1.</note> and seek after and affect the things above, <hi>you are risen with Christ.</hi>

                  <p>In all walking there is a motion of progression, a going forward till a man arrive at the end of his walk. So it should be in this walk, a going on by degrees and steps, till we arrive at perfection. Every thing that lives, moves by degrees.

               <p>ALL the works of God have their fit time, their opportunity. Among the chief of these is the Redemption of the World by Christ; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is perfected by successive Acts, that these might be the better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, the Church assigned several dayes to his honour. All the rest are gone before, this is present; and it ought to be a day of <hi>Jubile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 47.5.</note>
                  <hi>for that God went up with a merry noyse, and the Lord with the sound of the Trump.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For after our Saviour had fought the battel, and gotten the Victory on the Cross, after he had repaired by his Resurge that Temple of his body, which the malicious Jews had digg'd down, he ascended up on high,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Greg.</hi> hom. 4. in Ezek.</note> far above all heavens, even the highest of them. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> compares our Saviour to <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Vision. The Prophet saw foure <hi>Cherubins,</hi> whose likeness was that of a man, and every one had four faces: The first had the face of a Lyon, the second of an Oxe, the third of an Eagle, the fourth was of a man. Christ saith he, lively opens this Vision to us; A man in his birth, an Oxe sacrificed at his death, a Lion on the day of his Resurrection, and an Eagle in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension to heaven. A better sight it is to see him an Eagle in the clouds, than an Oxe upon the Altar, as on <hi>Good-friday</hi> we beheld him. Better to behold a cloud to receive him, than a grave-stone to cover him. Better to see him preparing for his Triumph on Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> than upon his Cross in <hi>Golgotha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Mount he came, after the 40. dayes of his return from the grave were expired. For so long he conversed with them from his Resurrection,<note place="margin">Act. 1.3.</note> being not willing presently to withdraw and absent himself from his Disciples, but delay his own honour for their good, In that time he inform'd their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and confirm'd their Faith: Their want of knowledge, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made them doubt: Their fear, which when time was, made them fly; his bitter Cross that before put them in a maze; their diffidence which brought them near despair, is by this his gracious presence in that length of time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell'd. Conclude they must and did, that it was no Spirit which they saw; no phantastick body suddenly appearing, and as suddenly vanishing: but a true substance consisting of flesh and bones, which their very hands handled, and their eyes saw to eat and drink before them: Thus of weak they became strong; of faithless faithful.</p>
               <p>Well now, suppose the 40. days are ended. Our Evangelist Relates what then succeeded to Christ and his Disciples; for these two take up the close of his Gospel. In which consider

Heaven it was, and thither now he went,<note place="margin">Act. 10.36.</note> that he might shew himself Lord of all.</p>
                  <p>Heaven is a very doubtful term, were it but a little above the earth it might be heaven; the birds that flutter above our heads, are called the birds of heaven, and the canopy of clouds, the clouds of heaven. Again, had it been higher, as to the Orbs of the plants, or fixed stars, heaven it had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. But besides these we read of the highest heavens, the throne, seat, and habitation of God, where there is the perpetual revelation of Gods holiness, glory, majesty, where there is fulness of joy, stability, and security; and to this place it is that Christ ascended with his body, having under him all other corporeal and visible sphears as his footstool.</p>
                  <p>This is well expressed to us by the Apostle, under the type of the High Priest,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.14.</note> who entred once a year into the Holiest of Holies, but not without blood; and so have we, saith he, an High Priest that hath passed into the heavens.<note place="margin">Godw.

                     </note> The Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was a type of the world; in it were three parts, the <hi>atrium apertum,</hi> the open Court, or Court of the people, where the multitude were assembled and the sacrifices offered; the lower part of the world is very like to it where beasts and men do live. The second part was called <hi>Sanctuarium,</hi> in which was the golden Candlestick with the lamps, this resembled the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Orbs, in which are the greater Luminaries and less lights.

                  <p>One thing onely give me leave to add, that being exalted thither, God said unto him, <hi>Sit thou on my right hand,</hi> which he never said to any of the Angels,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.13.</note> how glorious soever.</p>
                  <p>In God there is neither eye, nor ear, nor foot, nor hand properly, for he is a Spirit, and therefore not composed of such material parts; when the Scriptures speaks in such terms of God, <hi>Humanum dicit,</hi> it speaks after the manner of men, that men by what is done among them, might conceive what is done in heaven.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whom Kings will chiefly honor, those they place in the chief seat above them, even on their right hand. It was the place,<note place="margin">1 King. 2.19.

                  <p n="2">2. And as the right hand is a place of Honor, so 'tis a place of power and authority too; those who are at the Kings right hand have commonly most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and command in a state, <hi>Solomon</hi> having set his mother on his right hand, said, <hi>Ask on my mother, for I will not say thee nay.</hi>

                  <p>That then Christ was set at the right hand of God, intimates, that all Honor and Glory, all power and authority in heaven and in earth was delivered unto him; and Christ God and man receives this in his whole person, but collated

                  <p>His humane body assumed here below was despised and placed (ashamed I am to tell you where, had not he despised the shame) 'twas upon the cross be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two theives; in heaven 'tis advanced to an honorable place; there he hung like a poor creature, scorned by all, abused by all; here he is exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, seated in a chair or throne next his Father.

That then he went up on high, was for himself, and for us;<note place="margin">Joh. 16.17.</note> for his Honour, for our Benefit, comfort, and instruction; <hi>It is expedient for you,</hi> saith he, <hi>that I go away.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. This first was for his Honor; while he was below, no man more contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible; now he is above no name more Honorable; the cloud that carried him, the Angels that attend him, the heavens that received him, the right hand of his Father assigned him,<note place="margin">Rev. 19.16.</note> proclaim to all the world, that he is <hi>Rex re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum, Dux dominantium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Jews, Jews as they were, did what they could against him; they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to bring down his name, person, power; they vilified his person by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him ascend up to the cross; they disgraced his name by putting over his head,<note place="margin">Joh. 19.19. Mat. 27.29.</note>
                     <hi>I. N. R.

But God hath righted him in all these, exalted him in all these, honoured him again in his Name, Person, Power.</p>
                  <p>There he hung like a poor creature, scorned by all, disgraced by all; God now hath exalted this contemptible person, raised him above all, and seated him in a chair of state next himself. From the Father he proceeded, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world he came;<note place="margin">Joh. 16.28.

                  <p>On his Cross you may read his Name, and on a lower place it could not be

Gal. 4.6. Psal. 2.9.</note> but rules in the Church by his laws, in the hearts of men by his Spirit, over his enemies with a rod of Iron.</p>
                  <p>And this kingdom was the just reward of his great humility; It is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of many Angels, and many Elders about the throne,<note place="margin">Rev. 5.12.</note>
                     <hi>Tu Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine dignus, Thou Lord art worthy,</hi> to receive blessing and glory, and honour, and power; and why all this? but because he was the Lambe that was slain; as if they had sung, This Jesus is ascended, because he descended to the womb, descended to the manger, descended to the cross, descended to the grave: It being usual to settle the eminency of his power and glory upon the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. Thus it was done to the man, whom the King of heaven would honour; and that it was done to him as a man, it is also beneficial to us; for as Christ was not incarnate for his own good, but for us; nor subject to the law for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self but for us; nor crucified, dead, and buried for his own sake, but for ours; nor rose again onely for himself, but for us; so also he ascended into heaven for us also, honoring thereby the Nature of man. When Jesus was taken to heaven, our Nature united to his person was mounted thither with him.</p>
                  <p>Weigh but what Nature this was upon which God bestowed this blessing, and you must wonder at the advancement; that nature it was which God had said, <hi>Dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> whose principles were but dust and ashes, and whose resolution must be by the order of nature into dust and ashes: that nature which we made inglorious, and vilified,<note place="margin">Isa. 40.6.</note> vanishing as a flower, corruptible like other creatures. Behold and wonder, man that was compared to the beasts that perish, is again become in Honor; that Nature which in corruption is like other things, is taken up, and seated above all things, and being one with Christ made superior to the Angels;<note place="margin">Psal. 49.20. Ephes. 1.21. Heb. 1.13.</note> for <hi>cui An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelorum,</hi> for to which of the Angels did God ever say, <hi>Sit thou on my right hand!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. To see our nature thus exalted, may give great content; and yet there is in it that which may please us better; every man wisheth well to his body, and by his good will would have it immortal, and raised to the greatest honor. In the world it cannot be so; Tabernacles they are, and they must be taken down,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.1. Heb. 13.14. Joh. 14.2.</note> for they are set up in a City that cannot continue; the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the mansions are above, among which that they should remain, Christ is gone up to prepare a place for them. As then they must have to our grief their descent, so shall they have to our joy their ascent also; as taken down to the earth, so taken up to heaven; for if Christs body, then ours also, when raised, must be in that happy place; otherwise the head and members should be parted. He left behind him his pawn or earnest, his spirit by which he did descend to us;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.22. &amp; 5.5.</note> and he took our pawn, our flesh, that we should one day ascend to him; at his rising he took to himself the keys of hell and death, unlocked the doors,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.18.</note> and let himself our and all his; and so now at his taking up, he took to himself the keys of heaven, and opened that kingdom to all believers.

                  <p n="1">1. His Priesthood after the order of <hi>Aaron</hi> ended at his death, for he was to offer no more sacrifice for sin;<note place="margin">Heb. 9.26.

                  <p>For our comfort then, let the divel clogg his bill either with slanders or Truths, all penitent and believing sinners have in that high Court an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, an agent to plead for them, a Sollicitor to follow their whole business, an intercessor to step in upon every dislike,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.2.

Again, if at any time in an humble manner we bring a petition,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.13. Rom. 8.26.</note> and present it in his Name, as our High Priest he takes it, offers it to God his Father, and makes request for us.</p>
                  <p>The sum is, when Almighty God is displeased, he turns his Fathers eye from us upon himself, presents his wounds, his blood, his Cross, his death; at which aspect Gods anger is pacified, his indignation asswaged, his goodwill recovered; and our infirm petitions sent up with sighs, with groans and a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous heart, are accepted and granted; without him that throne were full of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement and horror;<note place="margin">Heb. 4.15, 16.</note> that he is upon it, gives us boldness to have access to the throne of Grace, and to present our requests with confidence, because he speaks for us,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.16. Joh. 11.42.</note> with whom God is well-pleased; he pleads for us, whom God always hears. Let those seduced souls of <hi>Rome</hi> find out other Advocates, Saints or Angels, and engage them to promote their requests in the Court of heaven; to us Christ is in stead of all, being assured that a prayer conceived with a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart, and offered upon the Altar of a contrite soul through Jesus Christ our Lord, cannot miscarry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Well then it was for us that ever he became High Priest, and well again that ever he was set at Gods right hand, and made a King, since his power he will also use for our good, and that many ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first of these is the collection of his Church, which is the translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some men from that great Prince of darkness,<note place="margin">Col. 1.13.</note> and the plantation of them in his own kingdom of Grace; the means by which this is done, are his word and the power of his Spirit; for by preaching of the Word, he beates upon the ears outwardly, and by the secret operation of the Spirit he molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the heart inwardly to assent to what is heard, to lay up what is sowed, by the power whereof some men are singled out of the world and translated into the kingdom of God;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note> These are called the precious separated from the vile, a chosen generation, a royal Priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people to shew forth the praises of him who hath called them out of darkness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his marvellous light.</p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:200414:156"/>
                  <p>By which you may judge of the collections made at this day; it seems to me to be such a gathering as the Israelites made in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 5.12.</note> when they were sent over the whole land to gather straw; for what el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. And when he hath by his Word and his Spirit gathered a select company, careful he is, that they be well ordered, guided, governed; for where no guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and governance is, the collected body will quickly fall asunder. His laws then he hath to guide them, and his statutes to direct them, and his Prophets to publish these, and his <gap reason="foreign">

In the wilderness, when God led the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites with a cloud by day, and fire by night, as the pillar moved they moved,<note place="margin">Numb. 9.15.</note> and when the cloud stood still, they stood still; as fire or cloud moved or stood, so also they went forward, or were at a stand. This prefigured how provident God is in guiding, and how orderly we should be in obeying his commands and directions. Where he moves before us in his word, or by his spirit, thar there we move to; but if he stand still, and shew us not the way, that there we pause and stay, not daring to proceed in the action, till we are sure we have an order from him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But to collect a company is to no purpose, no nor yet to set down an order and rule by which they shall be governed, except there be power to secure those who observe his laws, and punish such as transgress them. To this end also it was that Christ sate down at the right of his Father, that he might have all power bestowed upon him; and his power he will use for both those ends.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He hath power to defend his Church, and he will and doth dayly use this power for the good of his people. Though he sits at the right hand of his Father in heaven, yet doth he not forget his poor Church on earth, but either limit, or annihilate the fury and power of her enemies,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.18.</note> so that she shall never be overthrown. 'Tis his promise, <hi>That the gates of hell shall never prevail against her.</hi>

               <p>AS it is the last Article of our Creed, that concerns the history of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that Christ shall come from heaven to judge the quick and dead; so it is one of those last things which the wise man wishes us to remember, as a fit <hi>memorandum</hi> to keep us from sin, <hi>Memento novissima;</hi> whatsoever thou takest in hand remember <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as it is in the Greek, the last things,<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.36.</note> and thou shalt never do amiss. And these are four, Death, Judgement, Heaven, and Hell; and they altogether make up so good a lesson, that could we but learn it well, and carry it well in our memories, we should need little more teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We might spare all our Sermons, and forbear our vehement exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being nothing else but earnest perswasions and calls to good, and serious disswasions from sins; did men but call to mind that they were always dying, I had almost said, Dead men: That yet being dead, or asleep in their graves, they must thence be summoned to judgement, where if they have done well,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.29. Mat. 25.46.</note> they shall go into life eternal; if ill, into everlasting pain: This, this one meditation were a sufficient motive.</p>
               <p>But the chief of these is judgement, for all the rest depend upon it; Death is but Judgements usher that goes before it; heaven or hell that retinue that follows it; death would not be so fearful if judgement did not follow; hell not so painful, if judgement did not go before; he that remembers the last day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members all the last things, and he that remembers the last things, cannot do amiss. Let therefore that practice of Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> be our daily meditation,<note place="margin">Hieron.</note> Eat we, drink we, buy we, sell we, rise we, or lye we down to sleep, whatsoever we do, let us always suppose we hear the summons of the last Trumpe, <hi>Surgite mortui, &amp; venite ad judicium, Arise you Dead and come to judgement.</hi>

                  <p>And then there must be a day of judgement, for otherwise the Judge had been ordained to no purpose; and he must be a stranger to the Scripture that doubts of it; and if all other things which the holy Spirit foretold came to pass,<note place="margin">

This is to be read, as if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven with the point of a Diamond in many places. <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth it, <hi>For he cometh, he cometh to judge the earth. Isaiah</hi> foretells it again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; <hi>Daniel</hi> prophesieth of it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Joel</hi> describes it, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.31. And that I may end with him, that concluded the Prophets, <hi>Malachy</hi> I mean; he also mentions it, <hi>Behold the day comes, that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 4.1.</note>
                     <hi>yea and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, saith the Lord, and it shall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leave them root nor branch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I spare infinite other texts, because I hasten to those evident testimonies out of the new Testament; he that did not omit to comfort his disciples with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promises in the midst of their fiery tryals to be undergone for his name, did not forget this necessary comfort of his return again;<note place="margin">Mat. 24. Mar. 13. Luc. 17.22. Act. 17.31. 1 Thess. 4.16. 2 Pet. 3.10.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>And his Apostles after him repeated it, and urged it, as a main Anchor of their hope; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> proclaims it, adviseth the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> to comfort themselves in it; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth it, nay an old prophecy there was, as old almost as the world that taught us much; <hi>Jude</hi> hath it out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of <hi>Enoch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jud. ep. ver. 14.</note> for he prophesied of these things, <hi>Behold the Lord comes with thousands of his Saints, to execute judgements upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly of their ungodly deeds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which I have hitherto produced, tends to this purpose that since Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God hath by a perpetual succession of Prophets, by himself, by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles made mention of this his second coming, it ought to stand for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable foundation; that there shall be a day, in which God will judge the world;<note place="margin">Act. 17.31.</note> which yet may seem at the first glimpse to derogate from the honor of so great a Majesty. Even as if some great King should call before him the basest of his servants, and cause him to render an accompt of his trust; for what is man, or what is all the glory of man? Earth and ashes, saith our father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as the small dust of the balance, saith <hi>Isaiah;</hi> a thing of naught, saith <hi>David;</hi>

                  <p>But God, who is omnipotent, is also just, and therefore as we must give
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:200414:158"/> an account of our lives, so also will he at that day give an account of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in this world, and defend his own cause, and his own justice; that what he did in this World, was equally and justly done; the day shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it. Expedient therefore it was,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.13.</note> that there should be a day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Ex parte sui,</hi> For his own sake. For if he be just, necessary it is that a good life have a good reward, and an evil life the evil of punishment. But in this life it is not alwayes so, where the best are under the Cross, and wicked men crucifie them: Ungodly men flourish as the Palm Tree, and the good and godly are pressed and trode under foot like the <hi>Camomile.</hi>

                     <hi>David</hi> wonders at this, his feet well-nigh slipt at it, and the wicked grew presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous upon it. A thought came into their head, that God was such as they were, he had no better thoughts, no other ends. For be it that some few were made the examples of Gods anger; in one age a <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in another a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod;</hi> now a <hi>Julian,</hi> and then an <hi>Arrius;</hi> yet the most ended their dayes in peace, and descended to their graves in mirth and pleasure.</p>
                  <p>To remove such a scandal therefore, when God sees his time, he will up, answer all, satisfie all Objections, he will vindicate his wayes, and his wise government of the world, and make it cleare by this judgement,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.9.</note> That the world judg'd amiss of him; he was not slack or careless, nor gave his blessings over head; but that he bestow'd these to win the worst; who, because they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his mercy, shall then smart by his judgement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Expedient this is also, <hi>ex parte nostri,</hi> For our sakes. God indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows a reward upon his servants so soon as they breath out their souls.<note place="margin">Luk. 16.22.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Expedient this is for the discovery of hypocrites: <hi>The heart of man is deceitful above all things; who can know it?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 17.9. 1 Reg. 21.27. 2 Sam. 15.7. Mat. 26.49. Matth. 6. Mat. 23.14.</note>

All these things are to us <hi>in o culto,</hi> we see them not, we know them not; so that the foulest Hypocrite may pass with us for a good Saint; a Wolf in sheeps cloathing, for a harmless creature.</p>
                  <p>A day then there must be to put the difference; shew who dissembled with God with their lips, and who serv'd him with an honest and sincere heart. Now that day will reveale all.

                     <note place="margin">Deut. 32.29.</note>
                     <hi>O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!</hi> Something sure there is in this end worthy our sight, that he so pathetically desires they would consider it. The want of which,<note place="margin">Jer. 5.30.</note> caused, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> complaines, a strange and horrible thing to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Land; what it was, you may reade there; the people liked this sin, and loved that sin; which he presumes never would have been done, had they thought <hi>quid fiet in novissimo,</hi> what would be the end thereof. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was merciful, and might forgive more than they could offend; but for ought he saw, their case was desperate; when the end of all things came, he could not tell what end they should have.</p>
                  <p>A Consideration though it move us little, yet it mov'd our Saviour very much, and fetcht a sigh from his heart, and tears from his eyes; he earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wish'd, and the tears fell when he spake, <hi>Oh that thou, even thou hadst known in this thy day,</hi>

                     <hi>the things that belong to thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes;</hi> and so was faine to break off, the tears flowing so fast, that they interrupted his words, and forced him to weep out the rest of the sentence! Think not he lamented only the ruine of those goodly buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; it was their rejection, their stubbornness, their hardness of heart he wept for, who would not in their day know the things that belong'd to their peace, and so prevent the fury of the Lord in his day, of which this their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was but a fore-runner.</p>
                  <p>These teares shew, that the day of Gods visitation is like to be a heavy day. Those wishes demonstrate, that <hi>recordatio novissimi,</hi> the remembrance of the latter end, is a wholesome meditation, and that the greatest errours of our lives arise from the neglect of it. Did we think of it aright, we would not foreslow the time, but runne as fast from sin, as now we runne after it; come as fast on our knees to God, as with our feet we fly from him; in a word, arise, returne, and repent, before the terror of the Lord, and that angry day overtake us.<note place="margin">Eccl. 11.9.</note>

                  <p>But when will this day be? The question is too curious; and yet certain it is, that the best Saints of God have been very inquisitive about this point; gracious promises they had made unto them when this day came, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thought it long till it came.<note place="margin">Dan. 12.8, 6.</note>
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> asks after it with a kinde of passion, <hi>O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things! Esdras</hi> is yet more curious,<note place="margin">2 Esd. 4.44, 45, 51.</note> and demands upon the favour he found with God, <hi>Whether he might not live untill that time.</hi> A curiosity which possess'd Christs own Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; they came to their Master privately, saying, <hi>Tell us when shall these things be, and what shall be the signes of thy coming, and of the end of the World?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 24.3.</note> Our Saviour sayes much there, by which the approach may be guessed at, but in fine resolves them, that it was not for them, that it was not for them to know the times and seasons which God had put in his own power; <hi>For of that day and houre knoweth no man, no not the Angels in heaven, but my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 36.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding which cleare resolution, some bold Calcutatours there
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:200414:159"/> were, who in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> time would needs foretell the day. These Impostors used three kinds of perswasions; Revelations, Reasons, and counterfeit Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Apostles; against which St. <hi>Paul</hi> opposeth his Negative,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.2.</note>
                     <hi>Be not troubled, neither by Spirit, nor by Word, nor by Letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. Not by Spirit,</hi> for Revelation they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any; rather the contrary. <hi>To you it is not given. Not by Word,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 1.6.</note> for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from reason Christs coming on such a yeare cannot be concluded. <hi>Not by Letter,</hi> for from the Apostles no such Letters have proceeded, nor ever could be procured; they knew it not themselves, and therefore cannot in it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form others.</p>
                  <p>But neither Christs <hi>Non est datum,</hi> nor St. <hi>Pauls</hi> threefold reason,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Napier</hi> Posit. 14.</note> hath stay'd the itching humours of curious men, who out of a Talmudical prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, a Cabalistical Cypher of numbers, men and ages, and other light Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have set the period to the world 6000. years, which for the Elects sake may not be compleat. Others have yet gone farther, and out of I know not what spirit, presumed upon the month and day.</p>
                  <p>But why should men presume to know more than other sober men in this point, more than the Apostles, more than the Angels, more than Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as he was the Son of man? It is a kinde of Sacriledge to break into Gods holy place, and pry into his Ark. Christs Apostles were nearer unto him, in as much favour as we can be. The mysteries of the Kingdom they might know;<note place="margin">Mark 4.11. Dan. 12.4. Mat. 18.10.</note> others, yet not this. Knowledge might be encreased, as was revealed to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> and yet not in this kinde. Angels behold the face of God in heaven, have natural, experimental, revealed knowledge; <hi>&amp; matutinam &amp; vesper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinam notitiam;</hi> yet thus much they may not know. Christ himself as man, is ignorant of it; or else <hi>dicitur nescire, quia non facit scire,</hi> he is said to be ignorant of it, because he minds not to reveal it; and shall a lump of heavy clay sore above the Angels, the Schollar look to know more than his Master, or more than he intends to teach him? He is but a fool, who will be wiser than Wisdom it self. <hi>Secret things belong to the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 29.29.</note> and then let us suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to rest in secret, even in the breast of him to whom they belong. 'Tis dangerous to have an eare where God hath no tongue. God to discover how much this curiosity hath displeased him, hath frustrated the accounts, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of errour and imposture, as many as have pleased themselves with this curiosity. In this point there is a resolution, which is safe and godly,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.18.</note>

Luk. 21.34.</note> you shall have it from Christs mouth, <hi>Take heed to your selves, lest at any time your hearts be oppressed with surfetting and drunkenness, &amp;c.</hi> For these things slyly steale away the heart, load and oppress it, making it so drowsie and heavy, that it cannot look for Christs coming. The bad servant in the Gospel would never have become Master of mis-rule, fell upon his fellow-servants,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> abused and beat them; he would never have kept such leud company, eat and drunk, and been drunken with them, had he not been perswaded that his Master had deferr'd his coming. All his Riot is imputed to that presumption. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may impute the disorders of the world to the same cause.<note place="margin">Amos 6.3.</note>
                     <hi>Men put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the evil day farre from them;</hi> they think not the Judge is so near, the Assize so present. And this is it that hath brought in such a flood of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. A way yet there is to stay this inundation; remember St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:200414:160"/>
                     <hi>The Lord is at hand;</hi> and if he were at hand then, he is much nearer now. This is the old decrepit age of the world;<note place="margin">Phil. 4.5.</note>

                  <p n="2">2. For if you be not wise and sober, you will be heavy and drowsie, ready to fall asleep, and so unapt to perform another duty, which Christ out of this respect enjoyns you, <hi>Wath therefore, for you know not at what houre your Lord doth c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Mat. 24.42.</note> Come he will, that you know; but when he will come, that you know not; watch therefore. For if you do it not, you shall have less wit in your heads than every common housholder. For know this, <hi>That if the good man knew at what time the Thief would come,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 24.43.</note>
                     <hi>he would have wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and not have suffered his house to have been broken up.</hi> Christ is that same good Thief, he will steal upon us as a Thief in the night; doth it not stand us then upon to watch,<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.3.</note> because we know not the houre when he will come?</p>
                  <p>I speak not of bodily watching, but of the care and vigilancy of the heart. For a man may be asleep in sinne with his eyes open; and on the contrary, watch for his Masters coming when his eyes are fastshut. Will you then know what it is to stand upon your Watch? Prepare your selves every day to make up your account, as if the last day; search your hearts by the light of Gods Word; arraign, judge, condemn your selves for your sins; pray to him for Remission and pardon of them; be chang'd, become new creatures, stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gate, and look which way your spiritual enemies mean to assault the City, labour to repell them, and beat them back, and then you need not fear to meet the Judge. <hi>Plus vigilare, est plus vivere.</hi> He that lives best, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth most.</p>
                  <p>Nothing so like death as sleep; nor any thing so like a dead man, as he that is laid to rest. Will you then shew your selves alive? So long as you sleep in sin,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.34.</note> you carry about you the resemblance of a dead man; awake to righteousness, and sin not, and so men will know that you are alive. The Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> fled from God, and a mighty storme from above fell upon the ship, so that the Mariners, which they use not oft, fell devoutly to their prayers:<note place="margin">Johah. 1.4, 5, 6.</note>
                     <hi>But all the while he lay, and was fast asleep.</hi> The Tempest could not awake him, till the Master of the ship rouzed him with <hi>What meanest thou, O thou sleeper!</hi> I apply it thus: A tempest there is coming, and it is from God; the Sea and the waters shall roare. You and the greatest part of the world are like <hi>Jonah,</hi> fast asleep, you think not of your danger. Some few there are,<note place="margin">Luk. 21.25.</note> who are awake, and pray that the ship sink not, and at this time I supply the Pilots room; Those sleepers must be content that I rouze them up from their pillows of security, and ask, What mean you, O you slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers! will you go away in a sleep! shall your life pass away in a dream! Came you naked of goodness into the world, and will you return as naked! brought you no oyl in your Lamps with you,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.10. 1 Thes. 4.16.</note> and will you have none when the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom comes! Or do you tarry to be startled by the Angels Trump? the shril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest Trumpet that ever blew, the fearfullest voice to sleepers that ever sounded. What is it you expect? what is it you look for?</p>
                  <p>A long continuance of the world? That may not be; it is in its decaying age, and must ere long dissolve. Hope you for <hi>Methuselahs</hi> years for your selves? Nor that neither; for seventy, or eighty, or an hundred years is the largest grant. What yet do you expect? an adjournment of the Session; soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it may come,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.22.</note> but deferr'd it will not be; <hi>for, for the Elects sake those dayes are shortned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or suppose all this, that the world would last long, or the Assize were put off,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.20.</note> yet the day of thy appearance is at hand. This night, or to morrow he
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:200414:160"/> may send for thy soul, and exact a private account of thy life. To day a man, to morrow none. For in death there is no peradventure; in other things there is great casualty; <hi>forte dives erit, forte pauper, &amp;c.</hi> perhaps a man may be rich, perhaps poor; perhaps honourable, perhaps dishonourable; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps married, perhaps unmarried: but can a man say, Perhaps I shall die,<note place="margin">Augustin.</note> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I shall not die? No, no, death is a snare, it takes all, 'tis a hook that catcheth all.</p>
                  <p>Now look as Death arrests and delivers a man, so shall judgement find him; if it fell him a hallow tree, the grave will not make him sound; if a good tree,<note place="margin">Eccles. 11.3.</note> 'twill not make him worse. <hi>As the tree falls, so shall it lie. Cain</hi> died in his impenitence, and for that the Bill will be found against him. <hi>Judas</hi> in his Treason, and for a Traytour he shall be condemned; the like may be said of others; if the day of death finde them unworthy, as unworthy persons at the last day they shall be adjudg'd. He that goes out of the world in debt, must lie in that eternal prison, till at the last day he be haled by the severe Creditor before the Judge. When the Accuser of the brethren, like some eloquent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, will plead thus against an obstinate sinner, Not I,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.10.</note> not I suffer'd one blow on my face, one thorn in my head, one scourge on my back for this man, I shed no blood to Redeem him, I was not crucified to save him, I promised him no Kingdome for his work, except it were that of darknesse: yet hath this wicked wretch been at my service, and devoted himself wholly to my command. Judge O righteous Judge of the world, that which is equal;<note place="margin">Gen. 18.25.</note> judge him mine, who would be none of thine. After his abrenunciation of me, and all that is mine, in his Baptism, what had he to do with vanity, with lust, with anger, with covetousness? &amp;c. In these yet he hath yielded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self my servant. Behold my works are yet found about him; and therefore let him be wholly mine, who hath wholly serv'd me. O therefore beware how you part the world with any of the devils stuff about you! for you see he may claim it at the day of judgement, and you for it.</p>
                  <p>I end this meditation with that of <hi>Augustine, Momentum hoc est unde pendet aeternitas;</hi> Our life is short, a moment, a puff of breath in our nostrils, but yet such a moment that on it depends no less matter than Eternity; our bliss, or bane; comfort, or torment. It stands us therefore in hand, to hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band this moment well, to be sober in it, to be wachful in it; for then when the Bridegroom cometh, we shall go with him into a place of joy. And next I shall put you out of suspence who this Bridegroom is, which was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than He who was appointed to be the Judge, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

What the ambitious, to see him the Judge, who fled when they would make him King?<note place="margin">Luk. 9 58. Joh. 6.15. Mat. 27.34.</note> What the Gluttonous before him, who was offer'd gall and vinegar? Lastly, What will all the lovers of the world say then before him, who hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>That they love not the world?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.15.</note> It must needs be a great horrour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of face to the rich, that the poor; to the proud, that the humble; to the Lion, that the Lamb; to the wanton, that the undefiled; to the glutton, that the sober; to the ambitious, oppressing Grandee, that the contemnor of honor, poor Christ Jesus must be the Judge.</p>
                  <p>Then you may behold the nature of an evil conscience. It lies asleep here all the while a man lives, and Satan is content to sing Lullaby to it, as desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it should sleep on, and take its rest; But at the last day, when it shall see its Judge with these eyes, so terrible, so glorious, then it will stirre, then it will awake, and no <hi>Opium</hi> will bring it to sleep again; it will torment, attach, accuse, endite, condemn the man, and lay to his charge the contempt of Christ and his Word, his disbelief, and his misdemeanors in the day of grace. And he repenting and groaning in himself, shall say, Oh this is that Christ whom I had sometimes in derision!<note place="margin">Psa. 69.7. Heb. 10.29.</note> this is that Jesus whom I made a Proverb of reproach! this is that Son of God whom I crucified afresh, whose blood I trode under foot! this is that holy One, to whose Spirit I did despite! But now I see plainly that he was the Saviour of the world, that he is worthily raised and exalted to be the Judge, when I an unworthy wretch must stand and be judg'd at the Bar.</p>
                  <p>These and the like shall be the thoughts of the wicked at that day,<note place="margin">Luk. 21.26.</note> and their very hearts shall faile them for fear, in a woful expectation of what shall ensue; for these are but the beginning of sorrows.

                  <p>Put case these accursed souls should at that day put up a supplication to the Judge to this purpose, for some Remission, yet they shall not be heard. He that stands to listen, and to receive petitions now, will not hearken then. Be it they make a motion, Lord, since we must be cast from thy sight, yet send us away with a blessing; but this may not be, Cursed you are. Well yet if accursed, yet suffer us to go into a place of rest. No, saith the Judge, it must be <hi>into Fire.</hi> Well yet, if this must be our doom, yet remember us at last,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:200414:162"/> and suffer us not to be accursed, and lie in this fire tormen ed for ever. For ever and ever it must be, replyes the Judge. O let not our Lord be angry, and we will speak but this once: Since we be Accursed, since live in fire, since in everlasting fire, yet let us have there with us some good company, who may afford us some comfort. But this may not be granted, ye shall live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed, ye shall live in fire, ye shall live in <hi>everlasting fire, prepared for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels.</hi> Those for ever must be your companions, those your tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors.</p>

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:200414:162"/> the Advocate of his Church will ruine, plot destruction, and suffer a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Decree to pass against his. But if all this may happen, for Kings are but men, and some heads may be distemper'd, and some Advocates corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted; and others, though never so honest, yet through ignorance deceiv'd, or by power over-rul'd: But with Christ it is otherwise. For there can be no bad intendment in this King toward his people: in this head not the least su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion of a bad influence upon his Body: In this Advocate there is fulness of knowledge, and plenitude of power; those Clients then, whose cause he hath taken to follow and plead, cannot miscarry. 'Tis no small matter of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that we shall appear at no other Bar than of that of a Redeemer, where he that bought us with his blood, shall be our Advocate and Judge too. No more shall be put into the bill than he pleaseth,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1.</note> for he frames it out of his own book.

                  <p>Thus you see this one clause, that Christ is ordain'd to be Judge, hath Law and Gospel, Wine and Oyle, a Sting and Honey, Mercy and Judgement in it.

                     <hi>We shall not all sleep,</hi> that is, dye, <hi>but we shall be all changed.</hi> Such a change there must be, both in the dead and living; <hi>because flesh and blood,</hi> that is, the corrupt qualities, <hi>and infirmities of flesh and blood,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">50.52.46.</note>
                     <hi>cannot inherit the Kingdome of God. Chang'd we shall be all;</hi> and made of mortal immortal; of corruptible incorruptible; of natural spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; of weak strong; in a word, of earthly heavenly; of base and vile, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious creatures in our bodies: And this change shall be without any delay, without succession of time, it shall be in a moment, in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye;<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4.17. 1 Cor. 15.51.</note> as soon as you can shut your eye-lid, say some; as spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as you turn the candle of your eye, say others. The Trumpet shall no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner sound, but this change shall be made. But the doubt doth still remaine. How then do all die? Answer is made, that this word <hi>Death</hi> is taken in a double acception: Either properly, or improperly. Properly, for the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the soul from the body: Or improperly, for the mutation of the corrupt qualities of the body.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Many of the Latine fathers, and with them the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> because of those words of God,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note>
                     <hi>Dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return;</hi> and because Original sin hath over-run all mankinde, do except no man from the stroke of death taken in a proper and strict sense; and <hi>Aquinas</hi> is bolder, who maintaines an incineration of the body, from whose ashes an incorruptible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. But the Greeks, and some of the Latines collect out of the Apostles words, there shall be a change only, which shall be a freedome of the body from all corruptibility and mortality, and other defects. Which because it shall not dissolve the <hi>totum compositum,</hi> cannot be said to be a true, real, and proper death.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Calvin.</hi> in Thes. 1. cap. 4.</note> To their judgement <hi>Calvin</hi> subscribes, <hi>Qui dormiunt aliquo temporis spatio, exuunt corporis substantiam; qui innovabuntur, non nisi qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem.</hi> And this opinion seems most consonant to the Holy Ghost for these reasons:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The very Preface to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Text, speaks for it, <hi>Behold I shew you a mystery.</hi> Is it any mystery to shew all shall die? To be mortal and breath out our souls, needs no Demonstration, dayly reason and experience will prove it. The secret is, that at Christs coming there should be many men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main alive, who should not die: that they should be presently chang'd; of mortal creatures, become immortal, though <hi>dispari conditione,</hi> in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like condition; the good made incorruptible by glory, the bad made immortal for pain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And to this the Adversative particle here gives great strength, <hi>But:</hi> For it makes a plain opposition and distinction betwixt <hi>All</hi> in the first pause, and <hi>All</hi> in the second: intimating something to be attributed to these, which shall not happen to the other. Death to those, but a change to these. All shall not sleep, negatively, exclusively, but all shall be chang'd; as if he had said, Though all die not, yet somewhat there shall be that shall happen to all instead of death, <hi>viz.</hi> a mutation.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:200414:163"/>3. Lastly, This is consonant, and very aptly agrees with the clause of the next verse, <hi>The dead shall be raised incorruptible,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 53.</note>
                     <hi>and we shall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi> The dead raised; but we that live, changed; they shall have their Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; we instead of it, our Mutation. Doth he not plainly put a difference betwixt the one and the other? As Resurrection is a favour expected by those who lie in their graves: so is this alteration and change of the corrupt qualities of their bodies, an indulgence granted to those that shall be alive at the sound of the last Trump. And this I take to be the mystery which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reveals.</p>
                  <p>That I hold you no longer, Be the truth on which side it will, yet this is certain, than all must appear. Quick and Dead, and that the Judge will pass sentence upon all.</p>
                  <p>Look upon the prisoners at the Bar, and among them look upon your selves; for all you must stand there; when you can exempt your selves out of the number of the dead or living,<note place="margin">Rev. 20.12.</note> or be free from the appellation of high or low, small or great, then you shall have a better place; till then you must be content to be ranked with those who must hold up their hand.</p>
                  <p>The King here sits upon his Throne, the Judges sit upon the bench, and the Justices are Assessors, and sit by him, and God is content all this while to stand; <hi>God standeth in the Congregation of the mighty.</hi>

But then the case will be altered; He will sit, and they shall stand. He that stood waiting so long, and listning so long, to mark what they did upon their seats, will make all these great ones stand before him at the bar, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for what they have done upon the bench. Neither do you who stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, imagine that you shall be forgot, and never call'd for. No, no; all you, even the meanest person among you must appeare; not only the great,<note place="margin">Rev. 20.12.

God will call to these, and the earth must give up her dead,<note place="margin">Rev. 20.13.

                  <p>What prisoners therefore do before the Assize, that we ought to do before this great day, bethink our selves of an answer to every part of the Endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Not guilty we shall not be able to plead; for <hi>he found folly in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and iniquity in the best of his Saints.</hi> One way there is to take off the bill, and cancel the nditement. Amendment and Faith will do it; Look then you be provided of these against God shall call. Penitent teares will so blur and wet the Enditement, that it cannot be read. Faith will present such an infinite obedience and satisfaction, that the Judge will be pacified. It will make what is his, yours; so that what is done, cannot be undone; yet upon his book it will be no more found and read, than if never done. Oh how happy would the prisoner at the bar think himself, if after the commission of some notorious offence, a few teares, and some expressions of sorrow, the leaving off his old course, and becoming a new man, would save his life! Your case is better; this sorrow and reformation will availe you. While there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are in these prisons of your bodies, and are not yet brought to the bar,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:200414:164"/> let your eyes run down with tears for what is past, and become new men; and so though you must stand at the bar, yet you shall not be condemn'd as Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.</p>

                     <hi>My little children of whom I travel in the Lord,</hi> and should judge it my happiness to present you to the Judge,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.19. Heb. 13.17.</note>

                     <hi>and condemne it; for they repented at the Preaching of</hi> Jonas, <hi>and behold a greater than</hi> Jonas <hi>is here!

                  <p>For, methinks, I heare the last Trump sounding, the Judge set upon the Tribunal, the Books opened, Christians set to the Barre; and the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivites</hi> on one hand, and the Queene of the South on the other, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding and libelling, and that justly against them. She enditing them for their ignorance and negligence; and they impleading them for their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, irrepentance, and intemperance. To which accusation what will be replyed, I see not; Lay the fault upon <hi>Jonah</hi> you cannot; for the Prophet hath lift up his voice in your streets, cryed he hath early and late, <hi>Repent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 3.2. Luk. 9.56.</note>

Look about for Advocates, you can finde none, Accusers many. Your very silence speaks you guilty, and your Guilt calls for Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Jonah 3.8.</note>And yet I know what you may answer, We have sinned with <hi>Ninivee,</hi> but we have repented with <hi>Ninivee;</hi> we have done wickedly as that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed City, but we have cried mightily to God, and washed off that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with a bathe of teares; proudly and presumptuously we offended, but for this we appeared in Sack-cloth and ashes before thee. We once turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our eare, and would not heare one wiser than <hi>Solomon</hi> speaking by his Embassadours to us;<note place="margin">1 King. 10.8.</note> but after we confessed, <hi>That happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee, and that heare thy wisdome.</hi> Now such is the Rhetorick of this Apology, that if found true, it will melt the bowels of the Judge into compassion; stand up he will in the behalf of his Elect, and ask, What <hi>Ninivite</hi> dare rise up against them? What black-faced Queen of the South judge and condemn these peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.

                     <hi>and for my Nams-sake have blotted out their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.</hi>

Thus therefore while it is call'd to day, if you wrestle, you shall have a blessing; Thus if you contend, you shall wear a Crown.</p>
                  <p>The Judge on the Throne at the last day will say unto you, <hi>Come ye Blessed.</hi> These are the men who weakly fouled their Garments, but they have washed them in the blood of the Lamb. These are they who

                  <p>My joy it is to reward them, and their joy to be thus rewarded: And this joy shall no man take from them; For ever and ever they shall be happy, and follow the Lamb wheresoever he goeth: Which God grant to us all in his good time, for his Son Jesus Christs sake: To whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all Glory and Honour world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is more than thirty three years since your grave and prudent father committed you to my tuition, being then but of tender age; but even then I confess soft and excellent wax, apt to receive a clear impression of learning, vertue, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I should do you wrong, if <hi>I</hi> did not acknowledge that you were even then ingenious, and industrious, and so staid and grave beyond your years, that you promised to be the man, which I now hear you are, sober in your wayes, prudent in your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, just in your dealings, pious in your devotions, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in your Religion, which in this shaking age is no small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. My hopes of you were great in your minority, and in my old age it is my comfort, that they are not frustrated. It is now about thirty years since I saw you; yet to give you assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that as yet I bear you fresh in memory, I have presumed to dedicate the Third Part of my Meditations of the Creed to your name and protection. I know that of the rest it will need a shield, which your judgement ripened by time is able to afford it, and my presumption is you will.</p>
            <p>And I hope it shall not offend, that I have joyn'd your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with you, in whom I have no other interest but that of your parents, a vertuous, pious, and prudent couple whom I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd in their lives, and do not forget in their graves. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them is to me yet precious, and therefore I have brought my box of spikenard, as desirous to embalm it. Which yet I confesse is far inferior to that perfume which you three
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:200414:166"/> green branches of that excellent root send forth. 'Tis the desire of every man to be immortal; which because he cannot be in himself, his study is to preserve that immortality in his seed Nor wealth, nor wit, nor policy can ever perpetuate that. The Philosopher makes it the possession of vertue, the Divine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and they both say truth, the difference being easily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, since vertuous Religion, and Religious vertue is the sole way to perpetuate a Noble family. Go on then you dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who lay in the same womb, let Religion be your rule, and the practice of vertue the Expresse, and I shall not doubt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of your memory to posterity.</p>
            <p>I am perswaded you need no Nomenclator. But there be some who are of such a busie nature, that they will be giving ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice where no need is. And among these Polypragmons I shall bear it, if you rank me. However love may bring a mantle, and cover this fault of old age, which is by nature Talkative. In quicker words, if what <hi>I</hi> present here, may any way be servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make you more knowing and practical in the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I have my end. As for my freedom, I humbly crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, being one who desires that you may remain three bodies with one heart, as at this distance I hear you do, and that with one heart you may be the servants of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom</p>

                     <p>And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sate upon each of them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are this day met to bless God for blessing us, to give him thanks for the best gift that he ever gave; As upon this day, he sent down according to our Saviours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, the holy Ghost, and for that, Hallowed be his Name. This was one of those <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Ver. 11.</note> those wonderful works of God; which the Apostles had no sooner recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but published: So wonderful,<note place="margin">Ver. 12.</note> that all that were present were amazed at it; they doubted, they knew not what it meant: So wonderful, that there were not tongues enough on earth to spread it abroad, except there came a supply from heaven: That as every Nation received a share of the gift, so there might be in every Nation some to magnifie God for it.</p>
               <p>And they who will not be perswaded to magnifie his holy Name for this Donation, will hardly be moved to make it great for any: Because all the wonderful works of God, though great in themselves, though good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet are not beneficial and good to us, till the holy Ghost seals and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers them. For every man may take a threefold view of his own condition. As he is a meer man, as a Christian, and as born againe. For every man is not a Christian; the Heathens are not so; nor every Christian is not born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:200414:167"/> the wicked are not so. His Manhood he hath from God the Father. He made him and all the world. His Christian Name from Christ, for he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed him, and all mankinde: But his new-birth from the holy Ghost, for he sanctifies him, and all the elect people of God. This Trinity of graces pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from this Trinity of persons.</p>
               <p>Now to what purpose had either of the two first been bestowed, had it not been for this third? For had we not been be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n again of water and the Spirit, into heaven we could not have gone; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> it had been but a miserable case, either to have been made or Redeem'd. Of our making there is no doubt; for every man will confess, that it is but a wretched case to be made for Hell. The question is about our Redemption. For what! should this have been of no force, without the work of the Spirit? No, of none to us, had it not been for this Seal. That great work hath not its full perfection, till the holy Ghost be given. Full it is indeed in it self, the Ransome being fully paid upon the Cross; The blood of the Son of God there shed, being a sufficient price for the Redemption of ten thousand Worlds. But yet not full and perfect, and comfortable to us, till there be assurance given that it is made ours, which is the work of the Spirit in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Shall I speak to you after the manner of men? and I am bold so to speak, because the Spirit himself hath so spoken before me. Christ is the Word, and all we heare of him but words; words spoken, or words but written. And a word, ye know, is of no force, yea though written, which we call a Deed or Obligation, till the Seal be fixed and impressed; that is it which makes it au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical. God hath borrowed the terms from us, and speaks to us in our own language. A fair conveyance and Charter we have to produce for a pardon and eternal life; many gracious promises, many glorious prerogatives, words enough extant in his book to raise our hearts. What want we yet? The seal. Could we but once finde them sealed and delivered over unto us, we might be secure. This also our good Father, and gracious Redeemer is pleased to do: He vouchsafes to give us of his holy Spirit, <hi>by whom we are sealed to the day of redemption;</hi> and so by his signature, whatsoever is contained in the Deed to our comfort, is made over to us.</p>
               <p>Farther, put case an Act or Deed be sealed, as it happens in the VVill of a Testator, yet till an Administrator or Executor be allowed and admitted, all's in suspence; no Legacy can be sued for, nor any Creditor look for satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A faire VVill we have confirmed by the Death of the Testator, I mean our bountiful Lord and Master Jesus Christ; in it not the youngest childe or poorest servant of his family, but hath a rich Legacy bequeath'd him. But there was no Administrator declared till the Spirit descended. After ten days the Sonne from the Father sends down the holy Ghost with Letters (as I may so say) of Administration (for the Administration is the Spirits) and he conveighs over to every one,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.5.</note> what is freely and graciously bestowed in the VVill.</p>
               <p>I shall yet farther make this point more plaine to you. There's not any thing in Religion can do you any good, were it not for the Holy Ghost; your Baptisme, our preaching, your receiving, our and your praying were all in vaine. Begin with that with which all begin; go to the Font and wash there, and what shall ye wash off, without the Spirit of God cleanse the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? you may perhaps wash off a few spots of the body, but your souls will be ne're the cleaner, if the Spirit of God move not upon the water, and make it the Laver of Regeneration.<note place="margin">Joh. 3.</note> From the Font step to the Pulpit, and our words will be found to be but as a <hi>sounding brass,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 1 Cor. 3.6. 2 Cor. 3.6.</note>
                  <hi>or a tinkling Cymbal,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Spirit gives life to them; for he that <hi>plants</hi> is nothing, and he that <hi>waters</hi> is nothing, <hi>but God that gives the encrease.</hi> He must put life into our
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:200414:167"/> words, they are otherwise but <hi>a killing, and a dead Letter.</hi> Go yet higher, though with much feare and reverence, and approach the Holy Table; and what behold you now there but bread and wine? were they more, such as the new Religion of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, the very flesh, and very blood of the Son of God; yet if the Spirit come not thither, the receivers were ne're the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If you bring not Faith and Repentance with you, which are the graces of this holy Spirit, you receive no benefit,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.27. Joh 6 63.</note> nay much hurt by that which you there receive. <hi>The flesh profiteth nothing.</hi> Lastly, remove into your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, and make your petitions with <hi>Daniel, three times aday;</hi> and from thence remove to this holy place;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26, 27.</note> unless the Spirit of God come <hi>and help our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and make intercession with us with sighs and groans that cannot be uttered,</hi> all's to no purpose. For we know not how nor what to pray, and therefore cannot expect to receive much. So necessary a gift this was of the Holy Ghost, because for us no good thing could be done, or by us nothing done acceptable to God without it: nor Christs merits sealed to us, nor our service pleasing to him. To have been born, to have dyed, to have ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, are Acts of Mercy and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>jesty: but till we come to be partakers of the Divine Nature, be joyn'd to him by his Spirit, as he was joyn'd to us by his flesh, we are but <hi>animales,</hi> meer natural men; men of soul, not of the Spirit. And this is a certain rule, that <hi>animalis homo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.19.</note> the Natural man that never receiv'd the Spirit, perceives, relisheth, tastes not the things of God. You know it was the first Question that St. <hi>Paul</hi> asked when he came to <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 19.2.</note>
                  <hi>Whether they had received the Spirit?</hi> as much as to say, If you have not receiv'd him, you have yet receiv'd nothing, all's to no purpose, for nothing will do you good.</p>
               <p>It is not then without great reason, that among those foundations of our belief, this also of the Holy Ghost is laid for one. The summe of which, is, That I believe the Holy Ghost to be the third person in the blessed Trinity, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with the Father and the Son, but proceeding from both: That he is the Lord and giver of life, and that he spake by the Prophets. And therefore as I believe, and worship, and glorifie God the Father as my Creator and dayly Protector, and God the Son as my Redeemer and Mediator: so also I relie upon, worship, and glorifie God the Holy Ghost as my dayly Comforter, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structor, and Sanctifier; who works all grace and vertue in me, being by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a lump of sinne and mass of corruption. Of whom, that you may have the fuller knowledge, by his help and assistance, I have conceiv'd these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meditations; taking my rise from this story of his descent so fully set forth unto us by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in the words I but even now read unto you.

                  <p>Though Religion be not tyed to time, yet the practice thereof requires a set time allotted to it. For remove the circumstances, where, when, and by whom Religious duties shall be performed, and you shall finde men will not be long Religious. Hence Religious minds, as they have alwayes had their Sacred places where, and their Sacred persons by whom, so also have they had their Sacred set dayes when to serve God.</p>
                  <p>Now God is either served with an humble, pensive, sorrowful soul, or with a joyful, merry, and glad heart; and both have their vicissitudes, both their dayes. As God deals with us, so we must behave our selves to him. Joy and grief divide our time, and mark out our dayes with black and white stones. On such a day God hath or doth deale us a blessing: Let us rejoyce and be glad in it. On that other he sends us a Cross, sack-cloth and ashes are fit Robes for it. God likes not, that man be like the sullen earth from which he came; A brutish lump, unsensible of the hand that does him good or evil. And therefore he is best pleased, that as he divides to us, so we divide with him; express upon its day both Passions: Joy, upon that day he does us good; and grief upon that day we suffer under his hand. And upon this ground it is that the Church hath differenced her time, marked out some for fasting dayes, others for festival solemnities. With those dayes of pensive dejection I will not meddle; my Text calls me to speak of a Feast.</p>
                  <p>A Feast and a Religious Feast. Now a Religious Feast will alwayes put us in mind of a benefit sent from heaven; The day on which it is kept, being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced above other dayes, because that some stream of mercy springing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, hath overflowed the Land in which we live. For it is with dayes as it is with men; equal they are <hi>in esse naturae,</hi> all equally from the ground; even the first <hi>Adam</hi> was but an earthen vessel; and the best since but sherd; of that old Pot. When mens bones lie scattered before the pit, you may see of what
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:200414:168"/> mettal their pitchers were. No man can distinguish betwixt a Ribb of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and <hi>Dives</hi> bones: But <hi>in esse morali,</hi> in state and condition, a vast dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and imparity there is. For God hath distinguished these earthen Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels; made some to honour, some to dishonour; some he hath blessed and raised, as Kings, Princes, &amp;c. some he hath consecrated and appropriated to himself as Priests and Prophets; some he hath passed by and brought low, and suffered to lie among the pots still.</p>
                  <p>Thus hath he done by the dayes of the year; though, as the Author of all,<note place="margin">Ecclus. 33.9, 10, 11, 12.</note> he hath measured them out by the periodick motion of the sun, yet hath he not given the same honour to one, that he hath conferred upon another: Some he hath advanced to be Holy, other he hath passed by as common days. These he hath put among the dayes to number; Those he hath exalted, and made high dayes, setting them above their fellows for a holy purpose. Those are numeral only; These are Festival. And that I may follow the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son a little further; As men that are advanced by their Prince above the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, have commonly endowments and qualities of minde or body more than ordinary: so also these dayes that God hath advanc'd above the rest, have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of extraordinary and principal esteem, for which they have been hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. In them there was <hi>opus privelegiatum,</hi> some peculiar work which God did on them. No day being better than another, but as it is a Memorial of some grace or favour which God had done on that day more than other.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The Law of Nature or Dictates of reason taught the very Heathen thus much, but God his own people; and therefore for higher blessings, he set aside higher dayes: Such were,</p>

                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:200414:169"/>1. The weekly Sabbath to the memory of the Creation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Monthly the New Moons, to thank him for the beginning of time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Annually, their Anniversaries for other blessings; as first that of the Tabernacles to bring to their minds,<note place="margin">Deut. 15.</note> that however now they lodged in seiled houses, yet the time was when their fathers were worse entertained; for as pilgrims and strangers they lodged in Tents and Tabernacles. Then that of the Passeover to continue a Commemoration of their great deliverance from <hi>Egypt.</hi> Lastly, this of Pentecost to be kept yearly, the 50. day after the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the Passeover, to which our <hi>Whitsunday</hi> now succeeds, and well it may. For as the Jewish Pentecost was a Commemoration of their Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on the 50. day after their departure from <hi>Egypt</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was this our Feast ordained to be kept the 50. day after our <hi>Easter,</hi> as a Memorial of our Law the Gospel, taught and published by the descent of the Holy Ghost upon Mount <hi>Sion:</hi> So that that of the Eloquent Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> was this day fulfill'd,<note place="margin">Isa. 2.3.</note>
                     <hi>Out of Zion shall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Hierusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. These benefits were publick to the whole Nation, and therefore God would have in them publick thanks. Which yet did not debarre any mans private liberty, but he might keep a private feast, and be thankful on it, when God bestowed on him a particular blessing.<note place="margin">Gen. 21.8. Gen. 43.33. Exod. 18.10. Joh. 2. Luk. 7.36.</note> Hence we reade of <hi>Abrahams</hi> great feast at the weaning of <hi>Isaac; Josephs</hi> feast at the entertainment of his brethren; <hi>Jethro's</hi> feast, to which he called <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and all the Elders of <hi>Israel;</hi> the marriage feast at <hi>Cana,</hi> to which our Saviour was invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and was present; and the feast in the <hi>Pharisees</hi> house where Christ was entertain'd. To abolish feasts then, were to debar the occasions of blessing God both for publick and private blessings.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. These grounds being well weighed, the Christian Church saw no reason but she also might do what was done before, in common equity and prudence set apart some dayes for a thankful remembrance of Gods benefits. As natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reason had taught the Heathen, and God the Jews; except Christians on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can plead a liberty to be unthankful, to receive blessings from God with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and dull heart.

Upon such a solemnity God expects that a man have a merry heart, and that he express it by a Psalm of thanksgiving, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made;</hi> made a day,<note place="margin">Psal. 118.24.</note> by conferring some extraordinary favour upon us. What's to be done then? what, shall we hang down our head like a Bull-rush?

Exultation the motion of the body, and joy the fruit of the Spirit, must be an unseparable couple in our Feasts. Begin within, make merry in the heart to God for the blessing you have received. Otherwise it may be the golden Calves feast right,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.6.</note> when <hi>the people sate down to eate and drink, and rose up to play.</hi> And then allow the body its part, <hi>to have a song as in the night, when an holy Solemnity is kept, and gladnesse of heart,</hi>

                     </gap>, when the Authour and Institutor of these is God. He is the Lord of all time, and may therefore set aside what time he pleaseth to himself. But in <hi>Hypothesi</hi> there is some op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; many of those now enjoyn'd by the Church are cast aside. For, say our New Masters, it is not in the power of man to command others to cease from their labours; to set apart a Feast or Holy-day to the service of God. Now against these I give out this Proposition: That
<q>Feasts of Humane Institution are lawful, and may be observed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I shall invincibly prove out of the Scriptures. Upon what ground did the Jews, I pray, keep their Feast of Dedication? where is the command or Law extant for it?<note place="margin">1 Maccab. 4.59.</note> when did it begin? was it not ordain'd by <hi>Judas Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabaeus</hi> about 165. years before our Saviours birth, for the consecration of the Altar formerly polluted by <hi>Antiochus</hi> who set up the Idol of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Temple? There was now no Prophet in <hi>Israel</hi> to direct them, no answer given by <hi>Ʋrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> Prudence only then and piety did move this

At this Feast we reade our Saviour himself was; had therefore humane institution made it an abomination to God, it may not be conceived, that our blessed Saviour would have Honoured it with his presence.</p>
                  <p>I pass by here that great Feast kept by <hi>Solomon</hi> at the Dedication of the Temple, and that ordinary Translation of their Feasts from one day to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either out of a Polit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Had the authority and wisdome no place about Feasts, how can that Dedication of these Translations be justified?

                     <hi>that the glory of the Lord filled the whole house;</hi> and that the second was never repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which yet with it mov'd all the Feasts of the year.</p>

For there is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in regal power, even in that of Heathen Kings, to ratifie and enjoyn what may tend to the worship and service of God. If therefore a Heathen Prince have power to enact a Festival day to the honour of God, shall not a Christian Prince have authority to take order for dayes and Rites of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Be it that these examples are no Rules, yet they may be leading cases. For what <hi>de facto</hi> hath been done without controle, nay with great accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, may be a warrant to us, that <hi>de jure</hi> it may be done again, and God not displeased.</p>
                  <p>The matching of contraries is a kinde of illustration to both. To our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival Solemnities, the dayes of humiliation are opposed. Fasts to Feasts. But our supercilious Innovators disallow not these. They acknowledge that a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil power may enjoyn a Fast, notwithstanding Gods command of six dayes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by vertue of the Prophets words, <hi>Sanctifie a fast;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joel 2.15.</note> and why then may they not as well think it in the power of the same authority to enjoyn a Feast, by tenour of the Text, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 118.24.</note> And it seems they do think so; for else what can be pleaded for the injunction of days of Thanksgiving?</p>
                  <p>Well yet, let reason and practice be what it will, there be that cry,<note place="margin">Psa. 74.8. <hi>Graec.</hi> &amp; Lat. vulg.</note>

                  <p n="1">1. First say these <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Theologues of Yesterday, These Feasts appeare not in Scripture; no precept, no command for them; and therefore the observation of them is Superstition, Will-worship, and I know not what.</p>
                  <p>But this assertion is like the rest of their Divinity; The very stamp shews out of what forge it came. Which of the Ancients ever concluded in adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphorous things, <hi>ab authoritate Scripturae negativè?</hi> For such a circumstance about the worship of God there is no command in Scripture, therefore it may not be observ'd. The Scripture teacheth not, hath not taught, will never teach all the Rites and Customs in Religion, which have been of continual use and practice in the Church. Such are set dayes for fasting, for thanksgiving, erection of Churches, weekly and monthly Lectures, dayly prayers with our
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:200414:171"/> families, preaching on a set Text, with divers others. Sufficient those Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God are to that end they were ordained, <hi>viz. That the Almighty be known to be the true God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 17.3.</note>
                     <hi>and him whom he hath sent, Jesus Christ.</hi> The essential parts of Gods worship are found there; no man may add to it, or diminish ought from it. The Circumstances are left to the Church, who then determines aright, when she enjoynes any thing consonant to the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Although in this case she hath much to guide her:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The equity of Gods Law, that enjoynes a thankful remembrance now as well as then. So that though our Festivals have no particular and special Scripture-warrant, whereby they should be set apart, yet a General they have, under which they may be authorized. For they are warranted by the equity and sense of the Ceremonial Law,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.9, 10.</note> which by the Apostles argument is yet in force. And so much is confessed by a great Champion of the adverse party, whose words are these,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The practice of the Jewish Church, which ordain'd and celebrated fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals, even then; when, according to the pattern in the Mount, was most in force, as I but now made good. What should I say, that the Worthies of those times perform'd some Religious duties without a special warrant? <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> paid to <hi>Melchizedech</hi> his tyths; <hi>Jacob</hi> vow'd them, and consecrates <hi>Bethel.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 14.20. &amp; 28.19, 20. Jer. 35. Dan. 6.10. Psa. 119. 2 Sam. 7.2. Joh. 12.3. Mat. 26.10.</note> The <hi>Rechabites</hi> enter into a vow to abstaine from Wine. <hi>Daniel</hi> prayes three times a day; <hi>David</hi> seven; Purposeth to build the Temple. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> breaks her box, and poures three hundred pennyworth of spikenard on our Saviours feet: Precept there was none for any of these particulars; they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them out of pious prudence; and yet I dare say of them all, as our Saviour did of the last, <hi>They did a good work, and well-pleasing to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No more reason then to brand this Religious institution of the Church with will-worship, than any of those formerly mentioned. Rash and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous ignorance it is, so to judge, and so to speak. For Will-worship is a Religion and service proceeding meerly from the fiction and fancy of a mans braine; having no foundation at all in the Law of God, nor in any just Law of man. The Characters whereof are, 1. That it is vaine and superfluous. 2. Erroneous. 3. Repugnant to Gods Law and Will. Now I wonder what vanity, error, or repugnancy adheres to the Church in the institution of Holy dayes? 1. The object of our worship in these dayes, is the true and everli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God. 2. The form of our worship then, such as at other times. 3. The whole service no way Repugnant, but wholly conformable to such Rules and Canons, as the Holy Ghost hath deliver'd for the ordering of external circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and external materials of Gods worship. All which shall be made good against any Opponent. <hi>Sed nunc non his Locus:</hi> and therefore it cannot be vain, impious, or erroneous. God will never reject it with <hi>Quis requisivit haec?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 1.12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yea, say it be not will-worship, yet there is much superstition in the observation of these dayes. Either an old Relique of the Jew, or else some rotten Ceremony of the Papist doth adhere to them. To retain them, is a part of Judaisme; and to account them holy, and dedicate them to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a point of Papisme; neither of which may be admitted by a Virgin Church. Thus these <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, who, while they go about to fasten upon us an affirmative superstition, ought to take heed that they be not guilty of a Negative. There may be as much superstition in Touch not, Taste

Let them then look about them, and consider whether they may not be as superstitious in standing apart, and not joyning with Gods people on those dayes, as they would make others in assembling with them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For who told them, that to keep such Feasts was to bring back <hi>Moses</hi> from the dead? The Apostle, as they tell us; who puts the Church in mind of weak and beggarly rudiments, and that he was in fear of them,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.9, 10, 11</note>
                     <hi>for that they observed days, and months, and years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But had they more diligently plowed with St. <hi>Pauls</hi> heifer, they might have better guest at his Riddle.<note place="margin">Judg. 14.18.</note> It never was the Apostles intention to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage bitter Invictives against Christian Feasts. He condemns only the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of dayes and months out of a Jewish opinion, who gave it out, That the whole world of Christians were bound to observe these, and other Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ceremonies upon paine of condemnation still, as hoping to be justified by them. Upon this ground to keep a day, is indeed to revive <hi>Moses,</hi> and call him back from the dead. This is indeed <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Vers. 9.</note> a weak and poor principle; the thought of necessary observance is against Christian liberty, and brings a man in bondage; let no man judge you to be so weak as to maintaine it. For all the Jews <hi>New Moons, and Holy days, and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, were but shadows of good things to come.</hi> As Jewish,<note place="margin">Col. 2.16.</note> out of date they are in the time of the Gospel. He that observes any of them with the minde of a Jew, saith in effect, That Christ is not come. But who is there among us, that observes a Holy day out of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</p>
                  <p>It is a meer fallacy then to argue from the condemnation of the Jewish feasts to the Christian; and to press <hi>St. Pauls</hi> words to the abolition of ours; which 'tis evident he intended against the Jew and Jewish opinion only, with which we have nothing to do.

                     <item>3.

                     <item>4. Lastly, That <hi>Non obstante</hi> the Apostles prohibition they had their festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals; and therefore it never was the Apostles intent to abolish Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an solemnities. For if the Apostle had a purpose to raze out, all the devotion of times, dayes, and months, why yet do we yearly in the first month celebrate the Passover?

                  <p>That we dare avouch, is, That these holy dayes are dayes hallowed, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, and set apart to the performance of holy actions. Holy they are in use, not in vertue: Holy by Relation meerly. For there is not any holiness either of infusion or inhaesion more in them than in any other dayes. Not in the conscience of the day, but out of a pious minde to God, and obedience to the voice of the Church we then meet to bless God for blessing us.

                  </gap>, altogether; which is expressely noted of this company, which was the first Church, <hi>that they continued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> When they pray'd, they pray'd altogether; when they heard, they heard altogether; when they brake bread, they brake it altogether.<note place="margin">Cap. 4.24.

But men may be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whose minds are yet far enough asunder; for there is <hi>Ecclesia malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> an Assembly of malignants. These were no such people: For they had but one mind. Many bodies they had,<note place="margin">Psa. 83.3.</note> but one soul and mind informed them all; <hi>they were altogether with one accord.</hi> Their heart was not divided nor distracted; one thing they aimed at, one end they all pursued, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. To the same purpose they were collected, and it was, how they might set forth <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In the place there was Retiredness; in their prayers devotion; in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions uniformity; in their minds unity and concord; in their intentions sincerity; in their stay patience and expectance; and while they were thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and prepared, the holy Ghost fell upon them.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of God is a loving and clean Spirit,<note place="margin">Wisd. 1.4, 5, 6.</note> and therefore he loves a loving and a clean heart to dwell in. That soul which is levened with malice, and sluttish with sin, is no place for him to come to. It is to Repentance that St. <hi>Peter</hi> perswades this company to whom he preach'd, before he makes them any promise of the Spirit. <hi>Repent,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Cap. 2.38.</note>
                  <hi>and by Baptisme wash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your sinnes, and then ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</hi> No repentance then, no Spirit. For repentance disposeth the soul, by emptying it of wickedness to receive grace. This is the method in which <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Purge me, cleanse me, wash me, make me whiter than snow.</hi>

                  <p>But it was not so much the place that they retired to, that moved Christ to perform his promise, as their importunity and constancy in their petitions. Promised he had,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.23. Act. 1.14.</note>
                     <hi>That whatsoever they should ask in his Name, should be obtained;</hi> and therefore here they continued to sollicite him. Two things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially they needed, and therefore two kinds of prayers they used; <gap reason="foreign">

A great Office they were call'd to, and they wanted many good gifts for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it; and for these they petition, and upon their prayer the holy Ghost descends.</p>
                  <p>The case is ours, a high calling we have, and many duties are required at our hands; whether we are to perform any publick office, or private duty, that which alone can enable us to it, are the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Being then sensible of our own wants, let us petition as they did, and we may speed as they did. The Holy Ghost no doubt, will come down that way that we stand most in need.</p>

                  <p>But then we must have another condition, which I here find in them, we must persevere, continue, and be constant, and wait upon God, and give him leave to perform his promise in his own time. Many things there were that might at this time dishearten them, and make them stagger in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. The place was such, that in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> the cause and doctrine of Christ was ill spoken of. Their enemies many and mighty, Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, that then were in authority; who if they spared not their Master, were not like to spare them.<note place="margin">Act. 1.15.</note> Their number was small, about 120. Their persons of no great regard, they themselves poor fishermen, with whom there were join'd some women;<note place="margin">Ver. 4, 5.</note> nor power, nor wealth, nor eloquence yet they had, to carry on so great work. Add to this, the promise made to them of power from above, was indefinite. No time set or prefix'd for this Baptism of the Spirit; sure they were it would not be many dayes hence; but how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they knew not. Yet against all these difficulties they opposed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and undaunted hearts, and still waited: still they continued in prayer.</p>
                  <p>This is a true Character of a faithful soul, ever to wait upon and trust to the promises of God. This is indeed a hard and a difficult trial. <hi>Saul</hi> was not
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:200414:173"/> able to bear it. <hi>Jehoram</hi> was much displeased at it, <hi>Why,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13.8, 9. &amp; 28.6. 2 Reg. 6.33. Judith 7.30. Rev. 6.10. Gen. 48.18, 19.</note>
                     <hi>should we wait on the Lord any longer?</hi> Flesh and blood murmurs at it. <hi>Onias</hi> would stint the Lord to five dayes. What should I say, that the very souls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar cry, <hi>How long Lord, holy and true?</hi> They, even they in their haste, would as <hi>Joseph</hi> did, alter Gods hands; where he layes the right hand, they wish the left; and where he layes the left, they wish the right; what he thinks good, men think evil; and so on the contrary.</p>
                  <p>But this is, as I said, in their haste;<note place="margin">Psal. 73.17.</note> for when they go into the Sanctuary of God, they are of another mind. For then they are resolv'd to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctants, and wait still; then content to let God take his own time, yet in their continual prayers to remember him of it. This is the afflicted people of whom God thus speaks by his Prophet <hi>Zephaniah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zeph. 3.12.</note>
                     <hi>I will leave in her an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, a poor people, and they shall trust in the Lord.</hi> And well they may; <hi>For, loe this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will save us:</hi>

                     <hi>This is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will be glad, and rejoyce in his salvation.</hi>

                     <hi>Feare not,</hi> saith he to <hi>Jacob, to go down into Egypt;</hi> assuring him that his hand, his help should go along with him; and the heart can wish no more. For as <hi>Philo</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Vult,</hi> He will do it. <hi>He will save,</hi> saith our Prophet; His Will is manifest by his promise. For promised he never would, except he had meant to perform it. <hi>The just Lord is in the midst of thee, he will not do iniquity;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>These are the three props of our confidence. These made the Apostles wait, and they must make us wait ever on our God; his goodwill, his truth, and his power. His goodwill was shew'd in promising; of his power or truth they made no doubt; and therefore they continued to pray for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.

Now these thoughts might be a notable motive to move their Master, who gave the Commission, to send down the Holy Ghost (without whose power it could never be done) upon them: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing usual with God to bestow Gifts upon all those he sends upon his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand.</p>
                  <p>Every true servant of God is his Coine. Now to mony that shall be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, three things are requisite. First, that the mettal be pure and lawful: Then, that it hath a right stamp and superscription. Lastly, that it be of a just weight. Good works proceeding from faith and charity, is as it were the material part, all of pure gold. The letters in the posie carry the Name of God. And that which makes it full weight, is the pious and honest inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of which they are done. <hi>Amor meus pondus meum; eo feror,</hi>

The Apostles shew'd evidently whose coyn they were. Their works were pious, their lives blameless; we hear hitherto of nothing but prayers and supplications. In every place they came, they produced their Commission, and publish'd it in their Masters Name. And at this time 'tis evident their intention was honest and pious; for gathered they were <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>When the Holy Ghost was given, you have heard, and what Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there were in them that receiv'd him. It remaines now, that I acquaint you
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:200414:175"/> with the manner how he came, which was evident to two senses, the eare, and the eye. To the eare in a noyse; To the eye by a light.

                     <hi>1.</hi> A Sound.</head>
                  <p>Before men enter the house, they usually knock at the door, and so shew that there is some body present, that would willingly be admitted in: So the Spirit here first by this sound gives notice of his approach, stands at the door as it were, and knocks, that they to whom he was sent, might open unto him. And it seems he knock'd so loud,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.20.</note> that all <hi>Hierusalem</hi> heard it: For at this sound the multitude came together,<note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> and was amaz'd to hear it. It seemes to me, to have been like the voice of some Trumpet, clear, and certain, which brought these devout Jews and Proselytes that dwelt at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> so directly to the house whence this sound proceeded, to know the cause of this sudden Alarum.</p>
                  <p>Being assembled, probable it is that the Apostles miraculously honoured with the fiery tongues, which sate upon their heads as some conceive, went out unto them. <hi>Carthusian</hi> thinks into the Temple; For the upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in which they were, was not capable possibly of such a multitude, of which three thousand were converted upon <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon. However it were, this sound was loud, distinct; and it wrought so much upon them, that it brought them together to enquire of this wonder.</p>
                  <p>This sound at the sixth verse is call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a voice;</hi> so that a man may guess there was somewhat Articulate in it; and if so, they must run together the more willingly. Christ by his Spirit descended not now as at his Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty all in silence,<note place="margin">Psa. 72.6.</note> as raine into a fleece of wool, but openly, and with a great sound; not in humility, but in Majesty, that he might make it known, that he was exalted, that he was gone to heaven, that he was seated on the right hand of God. And from thence he shed forth this, which they saw and heard. Saw, in the fiery tongues; Heard, in the sound and voice. This shews,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Spirit of Christ is no dumb Spirit, but vocal; A sound gone out into all Lands, heard in all ages. <hi>Enoch</hi> sounded it abroad by his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, <hi>Noah</hi> by his preaching, <hi>Moses</hi> caused it to be heard by the Jews; and when <hi>John</hi> came, he noysed it abroad. For he was <hi>vox clamantis;</hi> Christ was the Word,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.23. Psa. 19.3.</note> he the sound only to bring it to the ear. And what were the Apostles else? voices only, whose sound went out into all lands.</p>
                  <p>And it is not without reason, that the holy Ghost thus descended in a sound first, that brought the multitude together, and after spake by the Apostles tongues more distinctly to them. For it shews us the way by which the holy Ghost works by the Word.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The noyse of waters goes first, and the roaring thereof is heard afar off, and causeth men to run together to enquire the cause. But it is no distinct voice.

                     </note> that upon occasion, as <hi>Pericles,</hi> can speak Thunder and Lightning, strike fear and terrour into them, whom the meer sound and voice of the waters brought together. Such was the Parable of <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David;</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Now after this succeeds Harpers. These are skilful Musicians, and melodious musick they bring to our ears after the Thunder. For such is the operation of the Holy Ghost by the Word, that after the heart is terrified and mollified by the Thunder-clap, it sounds forth a pleasant and pleasing time of mercy to the penitent. The Thunder was over, and <hi>David</hi> hears,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.13.</note>

                     <hi>Nineveh</hi> appears in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and God spares that sinful City. Every Chapter of the Book of God endited by this holy Spirit, is as it were a several string of this Harp; which being touch't by a finger taught to strike from above (for except the musician be skilful, the instrument will make no melody) brings to our ear a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly harmony. One string or verse sounds forth mercy and Remission; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grace and Renovation. This peace and consolation, that joy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, altogether glory and eternal felicity. In a word, no tongue can express the comfort, the joy, the power, the word of the Spirit hath to allay and pacifie the manifold risings and perturbations in the hearts of the Saints of God.

                  <p>And finde we not all this verified in this place? First the Spirit of God descends in a sound like that of many waters; this brought the multitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the effect was no more, but that <gap reason="foreign">

For they were but Eccho's of that voice which spake first from above to them; they took the voice at the rebound, and return'd it. For they sounded not any thing into the world of their own heads, but what this Spirit said before. <hi>Exspirabant quod iste Spiritus inspirabat:</hi> They breath'd forth what this Spirit breath'd in; much like an Organ or Trumpet which sounds out, and diversifies the Notes from the Bellows or winde.

                  <p>The Revelations of the Prophets, the Moral Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the voice of the Evangelists, the writings of the Apostles, nay all the good Sermons fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to that Rule, that perswade to faith and a holy life, are sounds from heaven. The Holy Ghost which spake by the Prophets, yet preacheth by us; And will you not then turn your faces, and once look up,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.</note> and enquire whence the sound comes?</p>
                  <p>From any hollow or dark Cave of the earth it comes not; for it is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour or exhalation.

It falls upon a Publican, and makes him an Evangelist; it finds a Persecutor, and makes him a Doctor; it meets with a Herdsman, and turns him to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; with <hi>David</hi> a Harper, and makes him a Psalmist. In a word, with <hi>Mary</hi> the sinner, and makes her a Saint; of a common Harlot, more chaste than the most Virgins.

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:200414:177"/> your ears, and are you not awake at it? are you not affected with it? Despise not the present motions of grace, though suddenly arising in your hearts, but take the wind while it blows, as not knowing when it will, or whether it will ever blow again.

So also a natural man is but a dry bone, sever'd he is from the body of the Church, he moves not, he stirs not till the noise of this Spirit comes, and then he walks with flesh and skin on his back, but hath not in him the least sign of life, of this spiritual life, till this <gap reason="foreign">

But when God is pleased to poure out his Spirit upon this flesh, it presently lives, it breaths, and the breath is sweet and odoriferous, exhaling from the flowers of vertues; and the ill scents of vice offend no more. In a word, such is the efficacy and power of this breath, that the old dead man resolv'd as it were into dry bones, lives, and breaths, and does all the duties of a living soul.</p>

                     </gap>, an earnest; that according to our several wants we might be supplied. Be we cool, and dull, and chill at our duties and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? he is fire to warm us. Are we soyled and fouled with the filth of sin? he is water to purge and cleanse us. Are we shipt with <hi>Jonah,</hi> and flying from God? a powerful winde he is to bring us back. Are we in distress and heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?<note place="margin">Psa. 45.9.</note> then he is oyle, <hi>the oyle of gladnesse</hi> to cheer the heart, and refresh the countenance. Are we in doubt of our inheritance, then he comes with his seale, and sets it to our conveyance, that what was prepared by the Father, and purchased by the Son, shall be fully possessed by us; for which he gives us earnest,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.22.</note>
                     <hi>even the earnest of his Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But perhaps it may be demanded, How shall we know whether we have receiv'd this Earnest or no? I conceive it is no hard matter. Remember that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Breath; and whether a man hath any breath in his body, will easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be discovered. For there be three principal places in which it will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned. For at the heart it will beat; at the mouth it will breath; and at the pulse it will be felt. One of these may, but all of these will not deceive.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I'le begin at the heart where life begins; for as in the life of Nature, that is <hi>primum vivens,</hi> the part that first lives: so is it in our life of grace, that part it is that is first quickned. God promiseth when he was about to make a new man, that he would first make him a new heart; <hi>A new heart will I give you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 36.26.</note>
                     <hi>and a new spirit will I put in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No better way then to know whether we have receiv'd a New spirit, than to examine how this breath is operative about the heart. If it remain still cold as a stone, then this breath hath not warm'd it. Or if it burn with fleshly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, then this breath hath not been receiv'd to coole it, to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but is not the promise there, that the conversion shall be into a heart of flesh? True, of flesh, but not of stone. Of flesh, for the softness, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, live-blood that is in it; not the impurity, corruption, and grosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and fatness. These are gone, and instead thereof there comes into it softness, that the Spirit may easily write the Will of God upon it; and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, that it will be sensible of the least prick; and so full of life it will be,<note place="margin">Psa. 51.17. Mat. 6.23. Heb. 10.12. Luk. 8.15. Psa. 7.10. Cant. 5.1. and 8.6. Prov. 19.21.</note> that the motions and desires thereof, will uniformly and constantly be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined upward. Briefly, it will be <hi>a broken and a contrite heart, a heart full of light, a clean heart, an honest and a good heart, an upright heart, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent heart, an heart that hath Gods seal upon it;</hi> which, as I now said, <hi>is the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But because <hi>there be many devices in a mans heart.</hi> And possible it is it may not be so sound and honest as we would make our selves and others believe; a wise way it will be to look abroad, and mark diligently what comes
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:200414:179"/> from within. The life is the best Index of the Spirit, <hi>novum advenisse spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, nova vitae ratio demonstrat.</hi> A new life will shew as easily that we have receiv'd a new Spirit, as good fruit from a Crabstock, will demonstrate that it was graffed. Now our life is best known by vital actions, which are Speech and Works.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Go to the mouth then, and mark what kinde of breath comes from thence. For if men breath not out the wonderful works of God, 'tis not likely that they have receiv'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, this breath. For the Apostles had no sooner taken in this Aire, but presently they began to speak with other tongues. The miracle is past, but the Moral lasts; upon the receipt of this holy Spirit, there will be a change in the Dialect; a change from cursed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, corrupt communication to such as becometh Saints. Mark the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Charge, <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouths, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph 4.29, 30, 31.</note> Then follows, <hi>Grieve not the Spirit by whom you are sealed to the day of Redemption.</hi> After, <hi>Let all bitternesse, and wrath, and anger, and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and evil-speaking be put away from you with all malice.</hi> Let no such stuff come from you, let these be put away. Why so? because it will be <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vamen,</hi> a grief, a sadness to the Spirit. He is the Spirit of the great God, and then for his honours sake: He is the Spirit that seales, and so for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits sake abstaine from these. These two, his Greatnesse, and his Goodnesse; his Greatnesse in himself, his Goodnesse to us plead strongly against all Impure, Obscure, Accursed, Bloody, Filthy words.</p>
                  <p>Judge then with what spirit they speak, whose lips are no sooner opened, but incontinent you may smell the stinking breath of their Lungs infecting both the aire and ears of the hearer! When I see the smoak vomiting out at the top of a Chimney, would not a man take me for a fool, nay worse, a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to affirm there were no fire in the hearth? The case is much alike; when whole floods of corruptions, accursed Oaths, smutty words, threatning and slaughter against Gods people shew themselves at the mouth, were it not great folly and a stark lye to affirm, that there were no filth at the heart? As the Wench at the Door told <hi>Peter, Thou art a Galilean, for thy speech bewrayes thee:</hi> So also this door-keeper of thy thoughts will accuse thee,<note place="margin">Mark 14.70. Jam. 1.26.</note> and blab it abroad, that thou art but a <hi>Galilean,</hi> because thy language is so broad, so sanguine, so malicious. St. <hi>James</hi> makes short work, <hi>If any man among you seemeth to be Religious, and bridles not his tongue, this mans Religion is</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>vaine, foolish, little to be set by.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But the last way is the surest of all, which is the Pulse. For if there be breath in any mans body, the pulse will beat, and by it the Physician gives a strong conjecture of the state of the man. For if the vital spirit beat even, and keep good time, then there is hope the body is in the better temper. But if it beat too fast or too slow, he knows the blood is over-cold, or too much heated; if weakly, there is a deficiency in the spirit; if not at all, or not to be discerned, that his Patient is in great danger, if not past recovery. I apply it thus: Works in the Scripture, good or bad, are appropriated to the hand; so call'd often <hi>Opera manuum, the works of our hands.</hi> If you will then know what state a Christian is in, go to the hand, try the work, have an eye to that. If you feele the pulse beat strongly, even, constantly, then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is lively, active, vigorous in that man; he is of a sound constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no danger of death in him at all. But if his work be over-hasty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an over-heated zeale, or come over-slowly from him, as if his hand were shrunk up or wither'd, or else is so weak that it cannot be known, whether there be any impulse or no, I dare not say the man is past recovery; for who knows that he stands or falls to the Lord of life? sure I am, he carries
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:200414:180"/> great symptomes and evidences of death about him. Yea, and much more when his pulse beats apace, and discovers nothing else but a high feavor of wicked works in him.</p>
                  <p>Shall I tell you my meaning yet more plainly? No man ever yet saw the works of the Devil, come from the Spirit of God. The works of <hi>Cain</hi> are from the spirit of envy. The works of <hi>Demas</hi> are from the spirit of the world. Obstinacy and stubbornness is from the spirit of perverseness. A care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less heart is from the spirit of slumber: Heresies, Schismes, and inconstancy is from the spirit of errour and giddiness: A wicked life from the spirit of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness. Lastly, prophaness from the spirit of Anti-Christ. And if we have a hand to help on these and the like enormities, you may easily judge what spirit it is that beats from the heart; whereas on the contrary, if we be ready to set our hands to every good work, have hands of innocency to lay upon Gods Altar; hands of mercy to extend to his poor, the pulse beats well; then are great signes of life in us.</p>
                  <p>As for what lies couch't in the heart, who knows? not we our selves; our own heart may deceive us.<note place="margin">Jer. 17.9.</note> And for the tongue, there is much deceit in that too; Men, as Parrets, have learn'd to speak, and that holy phrases for a need too; <hi>Hail Master, Thou teachest the way of God truly.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> puts in a complaint against such <gap reason="foreign">

They before knew and spoke but one tongue only, and that not very well neither. But now on a sudden they spake all Languages and all Dialects. A strange thing to hear an ignorant <hi>Galilaean,</hi>

Had you but heard the Apostles language before the descent of this Spirit, you might have heard them speaking low and earthly things,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.7. Luk. 22.23.

But they were now become men, they speak as becomes men, of great and high mysteries: Of this effusion, of the death and passion of Christ, of his glorious Resurrection, of his Exaltation and Ascension, of his Divinity, Power, Majesty, and of his Goodness in sending down these tongues. For this is the summe of the following discourse of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> which is managed with so great order, depth of reason, prudence, sagacity, that you cannot say that was <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Galilaean, Peter</hi> the fisherman, or <hi>Peter</hi> the illiterate that spake, but <hi>Peter</hi> that was Taught by a Tongue from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Could we finde the like either for power, matter, or elocution in the Tongues that are let loose at this day, we would no more object to them their shops, than we do unto the Apostles their Boats. But when these piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Praters, who pretend to a tongue from above, are so farre from any such gift, that they are scarce Masters of their own Mother tongue: When in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of setting forth <hi>Magnalia Dei,</hi> the great Truths of the Gospel, they sow vanity and visions of their own heart;<note place="margin">Hos. 8.7.</note> counterfeit and cropt opinions, for full weight of Christian Doctrines: easie it is to guess what spirit moves these tongues.

The first property of the fire is to melt what may be melted, as are mettals and some stones; and so doth the Spirit: For the heart of man by Nature is hard and stubborn. And nothing can mollifie and dissolve it into godly sorrow,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.29.</note> but the power of this fire; the Hammar of the Law may break it to pieces, the fear of wrath <hi>Atterere,</hi> stamp it to very dust, and so make it more capable of a dissolution, than it was when it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 34.27 Psal. 22.14.</note>'Tis Recorded of <hi>Josiah, that his heart did melt within him;</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> testifieth of himself, <hi>that the heart in his body was become like melting wax, soft and fit to receive an impression;</hi> out of doubt it had been near this fire. Be it then that we feel at any time the like effect, a relenting, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, soft heart, let us presently conceive a Grace to this holy Spirit, whose work it is to dissolve, thaw, and mollifie our Icy, hard, Iron hearts.</p>
                  <p>Many such stony-hearted men as live now the Apostles were to meet with in the world, a people <hi>alienated from the life of God, because of the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and hardness of their heart,</hi>

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:200414:185"/> to make them sensible; to melt them, no humane eloquence is able. That therefore they might be cast anew, and moulded to that shape which God would put upon them, the tongue of an Apostle inslamed by the Spirit of God was requisite and necessary.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now the end of melting, is to separate the precious from the vile, which is done by the heating of the spirits of the mettal. For these being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and set a work by heat, labour hastily to fly out, and so extend the grosser parts, that those which are finer and similare, may friendly meet, and those which are fuller of dross may settle, and be removed. And is not this the work of the Spirit, when the heart is heated and melted by it? That na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reason which God hath put into the heart of man, is mov'd, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently a separation is made, which by time is more and more perfected, till all the faculties of the soul are refined, sweetly uniting and joyning together to purifie the man of God, and removing the dreggs of sinne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The soul and body in regard of their es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, powers, faculties, or natural actions, are the same: Onely the corrupt and vitious qualities thereof are made to flie, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</p>
                  <p>Sorrow, Fear, Joy, are not abolished, but refined, and are settled upon a new object. Fear of punishment, is turn'd into the fear of sin. Worldly grief, into godly sorrow: Carnal mirth, into joy in the Holy Ghost: Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and anger to the enkindling of a discreet zeale: Hatred to the pursuit of sinne: So that as brute beasts, which of their own nature are very harmful,<note place="margin">Basil.</note> being once tamed become of singular use: so these inordinate passions in man, being by this fire of the holy Spirit refined and purged, are of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful use for the exercise of all vertues.</p>

But in all it was <hi>Ignis purgatorius,</hi> a purging, a separating fire. And if there be any true purgatory fire, it is this; The first consumed the sinners and sinne together: The second destroyed the beasts: But this removes the sinne, and purifies the sinner; it is <hi>ignis conflagratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> that burns not him up, but his work. For, according to his promise, <hi>He will sit in the hearts of his people like as a refiner, and a purifier of silver,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For as the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> devour'd all the Charmers Rods turn'd into Serpents; Or as the fire of the Lord that descended by <hi>Elijahs</hi> prayer,<note place="margin">Exod. 7.12. 1 King. 18.38.</note>
                     <hi>consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the burnt Sacrifice with the wood, the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench:</hi> so also this Spirit of God on whomsoever it descends, burns away the earthy and grosser parts of sin, leaves nothing behinde that shall be imputed for filth. It raiseth the heart to that condition, that though because we dwell in and with flesh, there will be spots in it, yet they are but the spots of sons, and our merciful Father will hide his face from them:<note place="margin">Deut. 32.5.</note> This it doth. It makes a man become another man. It changeth him within, and without. Within he hath a new heart, and new affections, as I shall shew you by and by. And without the man is not the same. For it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his tongue, his eyes, his garments, his companions. Of a slanderous and busie tongue, it makes an instrument of praise and silence. Of wanton eyes, Lamps of modesty and chastity. Of proud apparel, a rayment worthy of a Christian. Of leud companions, a choice of friends, by whose counsel and conversation we may learn to be good, and of good made better. Such a work the Apostles were to do in the world, which because it could never
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:200414:186"/> be done without the fire of the Spirit, therefore it pleased the Spirit to descend in this type.</p>
                  <p>Let it then be our prayer to God, that it yet please him to descend upon us in this flame, without which it is impossible to be made other men; that he would sit within as a refiner,<note place="margin">Psa. 26.2.</note>
                     <hi>prove, and try our reigns and our hearts;</hi> For then we should have new hands to work with, new eyes to see by, new tongues to talk of, and new hearts to love God; we should appear new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in body and soul: So that no Eagle having cast her beak, nor no Snake his old spoile, could be more fresh, and smug, and youthful, and nimble, than we should be in the wayes of God. As we were posting before to the wayes of Hell, so now we would as fast run the other way to attain the prize of Heaven. It were not a trifling profit, or an enticing pleasure, that like <hi>Hippomanes</hi> Apple could stay our course. For answer we would all friends and sins that should go about to retard or with-draw us in our way, as the young man in St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> did the impudent Harlot,<note place="margin">Ambrose.</note>
                     <hi>Ego non sum ego,</hi> God hath refined me now by his holy Spirit, and therefore I will now keep my body as a Temple fit for his holy Spirit to dwell in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And this work of the Refiner is the sooner wrought when the fire is brought to a flame; For <hi>flamma est maximè ignis,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath taught us; Upon which there will follow a great light, as we see in smoaking wood that is kindled, or a Candle that is lighted.</p>
                  <p>As at the Creation, darkness went before the light, so in the conversion of the world, the thick darkness of sin and ignorance did precede the clear light of the Gospel. This the Apostles were to dispel; and that they might be able to do it, the Holy Ghost delivered a light, cleare, flaming Torch into their hand, which they ever since have held out to the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note>The Prophets words were light indeed; but yet a light that shined in a dark place; but this the day-dawning that still grows clearer and clearer, or the morning-star that will certainly shew you the succeeding Sun. The effect thereof is Illumination, upon which ignorance being put to flight, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows knowledge of the Truth. And so the man that was blind before, hath the scales faln from his eyes, and sees clearly.</p>
                  <p>This the voice only of the Son of God can do; as at the beginning all was made by the voice of God,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.3.</note> he said, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light;</hi> so also is it now; let but the Spirit of Christ say to any blind and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant son of <hi>Adam,</hi> Be thou enlightned, and he sees presently. Without it the help of man is but in vain;<note place="margin">Isa. 57.19.</note>
                     <hi>I the Lord create the fruit of the lips;</hi> the fruit of the lips are words that bring comfort, life, light, knowledge; but that you attribute not too much to them in the mouth of the most splendid tongue, you must know that when they are effectual, they are words of Gods creation.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.27.</note> For the Lord must perswade <hi>Japheth to dwell in the Tents of Shem.</hi> The heart of man is a curious Lock; none can pick it, but he who is well acquainted with the Wards: Mens perswasions alone, are as one that will turn a Lock with a wrong Key; can but God be induced to help, the perswasions will be fitted to the turnings.</p>
                  <p>And yet these of men must not be despised neither, they being the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way by which God turns any heart; otherwise he would never of old have spoken by his Prophets, after by his Son, and by his Apostles, never have faln upon them in these tongues of fire <hi>to turn men from darkn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. The knowledge it brings is not confused and general, but distinct and particular. It is able to distinguish betwixt moral vertues, and supernatural habits wrought by the Spirit. Constant and uniform, desires, and flashes, and fits of piety. It knows not only the notions of Religion in gross, but is able in particular to apply them. In a word, it mistakes not one thing for another; Truth for falshood, and falshood for Truth. It apprehends not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary points of salvation obscurely, nor teacheth them confusedly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methodically, but clearly, and orderly; The understanding of that man is become like a rich Diamond, that receiving light into the body of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it there, and sends from thence a most glorious lustre; Of such those words of our Saviour may well be verified, <hi>Ye are the light of the world.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 5.14.</note> But of our New Lights it is nor so, nor so. Their light is desultory; that which is light with them to day, to morrow is darkness: Evil is mistaken for good, and good is called evil. Their Notions are obscure, and scarce intelligible, nor well understood by themselves, nor yet by others; as for their confused manner of delivering, it is notorious to every Reader and Hearer. Those words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> may well be applyed to them,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.6, 7.</note>
                     <hi>They have swerv'd from the faith, they have turn'd aside to vaine jangling, desiring to be teachers of the Law, understanding neither what they say, nor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they affirme.</hi> And can a man then endued with a small portion of reason, conceive these to be the sole men on whom the Spirit is descended in a tongue <hi>as of fire,</hi> to enlighten their understanding, in whom their light is darkness, confused, erroneous, disorderly, shifting as the wind, and variable as the tydes and opportunities of time and gain dictate to them? <hi>Credat Judaeus Apella, Non ego.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The knowledge and light which this Spirit brings, is heavenly and from above: It is not sordid, base, allay'd with base ends, and eclipsed by the interposition of the earth. <hi>Non remanebit extra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

For there be that follow the spirit of the world, and so much grow into the admiration of that blaze, and have their eyes so much dazled with this false light, that they shape the whole frame of their life and Religion by it. <hi>Diana</hi> forsooth must be a great Goddess, and worshipped, rather than an ambulatory trade be removed.<note place="margin">Act. 19.</note> With them gain is godliness, though what they embrace as gainful policy,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.5. 1 Cor. 3.19.</note> God pronounceth meer folly. <hi>He hath made the wisdome of this world fo lish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> He hath done it, and he will do it again. In this light men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce for a time, but at last it will appear a meer delusion, full of darkness,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.35.</note> smoke, vanity, nay, which is far worse, earthly, sensual, divelish.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:200414:187"/>3. A third property that this light or knowledge hath, is, that <hi>non haerebit in superficie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bern.</note>
                     <hi>non instar coeci palpat forinsea, fed profunda rimatur;</hi> it was as I said, like light received in a Diamond, and not in glimmering and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wood. He that is partaker of it, will not content himself with a little su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial neoterick knowledge, and like a blinde man grope at, and lay hold on every thing from without he can meet with:<note place="margin">Eph. 3.18.</note> But he will search the depth, the height, the length, the bredth (according to his measure of fight) of Gods promises; and having taken the just measure, will endeavour that they sit well about and fit him: which is indeed the right and only <hi>Sapere.</hi> When all's done,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.6. Psa. 51. Psa. 119.</note> this will be your wisdom. And I will pray to God with <hi>David, to create this new heart within me, and to give me this understanding.</hi> For <hi>sapere</hi> is not only to distinguish tastes, but with the taste to feel some delight, and to have a sense of the sweetness withal.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Lastly, The new Spirit is no windy Spirit blustering in the brain and fancy, making the owners to be men of imaginations, subtile and fallacious at an Argument, and in nothing else good: But it works upon the soul, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves it, and makes it capable of a new form. It is not a knowledge only of apprehension,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aquin.</hi> 22. q. 188. Art. 5.</note> but of approbation; a lively and effectual knowledge, that hath a quick and prevailing influence upon the life and conversation, begetting in the soul desires and endeavours in some degree and measure suitable to it: Which whether it be in our New Lights, let the world judge; whose know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, how little soever, is for shew, not for use; like the Lamps of the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Virgins,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.3.</note> which blaze as much as the wife: whereas true knowledge is a <hi>burning and a shining Lamp,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5.35.</note> a light that heats and shines, it warms the new man at the heart, and if they will, burns away his dross, and then shines by love: For Truth and goodness differ no more than the seal and the stamp. And that both these might flame out, as well as within, is another reason that the Spirit Descended in a Fiery Tongue.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For that is another property of the fire, that it does not only melt, purge, and give light, but it heats and warms any cold body that comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the sphere of its activity. But observe this diligently, that it gives light before it heats, intimating that knowledge, a clear evident light, must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede our heat; for else the fervour may be so great, that it may set the whole house on fire. The flame is call'd zeale, which is a passion compounded of love and anger; out of love it desires to be doing, and out of meer anger it frets when it falls short. To be in love, and yet to be wise, are almost incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible; and how far beyond all bounds of reason men in anger are transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I need not say. Zealots alwayes have had but an ill name for this. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary then it is for the regulating of this head-strong passion, that the bright Lamp of knowledge be carried before it; for so a man may discreetly see his way; be zealous in his know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>edge, and discreet in his zeal; do that upon sure grounds of knowledge which he is assured ought to be done, and do it out of that sincere love and holy anger with which it ought to be undertaken and done.</p>
                  <p>Among others this is one reason that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> gives of this type. In fire,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bern.</hi> Serm. 2. de Pent.</note> saith he, the Holy Ghost descended upon the Apostles, <hi>propter lumen pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter &amp; ardorem,</hi> both to bring light and heat, that he might make those whom he fill'd, knowing in the truth, and fervent in spirit; for as he hath it in another place,<note place="margin">De Nativitate Baptist.</note>
                     <hi>Est tantum lucere vanum, tantum ardere parum, lucere &amp; ardere perfectum.</hi> To shine only in knowledge is vanity; only to be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, a matter of no moment: but to shine and to be fervent together, a great degree of perfection. Happy then is that man, whose heat doth quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his discretion, and whose discretion doth command over his heat; for
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:200414:187"/> this man may be an excellent instrument to set forth with his tongue the wonderful works of God, which was the end that the Holy Ghost descended in Fire.</p>
                  <p>With this the Apostles were no sooner heated, but like the wise Virgins,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. Act. 3.14.</note> they had their Lamps burning.

               <p>Fill'd they were, and they were all fill'd, and that with the most precious gift that ever was bestowed upon man. The gift was a general gift, all had their share; <hi>All,</hi> not <hi>coll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <item>2. <hi>Elocution;</hi> for whereas before they were ignorant of speech, and could not, now they became Eloquent, and had the tongue of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned given them, abilities to express their Commission in any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>They spake with other tongues.</hi>

Holy the Atttibute, before then we go any farther, necessary it is that we enquire about that because there be that oppose and deny his Deity, and labour to make the world beleeve, that he is no other than a holy quality effected by God in the hearts of his Saints.</p>
                  <p>But this place affords us a strong argument for our faith to relie on: that he is a Person and no quality. For did he not here descend in a visible manner? Did he not sit upon the Apostles in the shape of fiery tongues? Did he not here make a distribution of his gifts? Did he not restrain also these gifts, make those to whom they were given speak what, and as he pleased?</p>
                  <p>Let it be shown when any quality or accident did assume any shape; when it distributes gifts, when it limits and restrains the gifts, utters what and in what manner the accident pleas'd and no more, and something may be said that may take off the strength of the argument.

These all are the works of a person, who exists, understands, wills, works, lives; such then he must be, since these and many more are attributed to him. Adde to this, that he may be blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, grieved, have despight done to him; and can a created quality be a patient, and suffer any of these indignities?</p>

                  <p>But I pray observe, that <hi>they began not to speak before they were filled.</hi> Here was an infusion of the Spirit, before there was an effusion; repleinshed they were first, and then they empty; which methinks, should shame the Speakers of this Age, had they not impudent Fore-heads, that cannot blush, who step up, and speak before they are full. Full, did I say? nay, altogether empty; empty of wit, empty of wisdom, empty of ordinary reason, empty of common discretion; I had almost said, empty of honesty, and morality; I am sure, empty of good education and learning.</p>
                  <p>'Tis an evidence of their folly, that they ply the Cocks too fast, and then you may be sure that the Cistern cannot be full. Wise men will be fill'd to the brim before they draw out; but these Taps, though there be only a little dregs and faeces in the bottom, will be sure to let it out; which they have made so evident, that now no rational man, except forced, or feared, will taste of their water. I call'd it right water, <hi>jejune,</hi> weak, cold, flashy stuffe; it hath no life, nor heat, nor any quality of the Spirit in it; even their own Proselytes begin to disrellish it. This, this is the effect, when men will begin to speak before they are full, fill'd with Wisdom, fill'd with Eloquence, as were the Apostles, which was the reason <hi>they began to speak.</hi>

Who can but smile to hear a tongue draule out at length <hi>Metaphó-ra, &amp; Synecdó-ches?</hi> Who can choose but call to minde the lispings of children, and the confusion of Languages at <hi>Babel,</hi> when he hears the stammering English that falls from their lips? Is such Barbarisme like the propriety of language in which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles expressed themselves? What they spake came from their tongues so clearly, that the hearers heard them speak in their own tongues, proper words in a proper Dialect. The miracle then lay not only in the variety of Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which they spake; but that on a sudden they should without any mistake, hesitation, or ridiculous pronunciation, or Tone, speak these Languages so clearly, and distinctly, which by length of time, long practice, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with any Nation a stranger shall hardly attain to: This then I reckon a part of the miracle, that in a moment they could <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>HERE we hear of a Suit preferr'd, and at first sight we know not by whom, or to whom; but certainly by one in love, in that he requests the heart and hand to be at his devotion.

                  <hi>that he was sick of it</hi> again, and dyed for it. Do you desire to hear the manner of his death?

               <p>It were too tedious to recite all these. In the <hi>Verse</hi> before, he puts her in mind of a wonderful mercy, that when he saw her in a very bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yet then he lov'd her: He spyed her under the Apple-Tree, upon which grew the forbidden fruit; then her Mother brought her forth, there she brought thee forth that bare thee; and yet, saith he, <hi>I raised thee up under the Apple-Tree,</hi> even when thou wert under guilt of disobedience, for eating the fruit of this Tree; I prevented thee with my love, and raised thee with my grace, that thou might'st be mine. The words then carry the same sense with those in <hi>Ezekiel, And when I passed by,</hi>

               <p>In this <hi>Verse</hi> then being raised, he justly prescribes her a work, that she be industrious, and co-operate with the Spirit of God: For when once God by his preventing grace hath stirred the soul, and raised it from its natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; then the free consent, and co-operation of the soul with grace, and help of the Spirit is expected; seasonable it is to make such a motion as this, to which, if we will not be ungrateful, we are bound to yield, <hi>Set me as a Seal,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Whether this action of the Spirit be Proper, immediate, Physical; or whether it be Metaphorical and Moral only, by which God doth dispose and perswade the heart to yield, let others determine.

                  <p>Out of that which hath been said, easie it is to collect why God useth so many Exhortations, so many Suits to that man, that he may be heard and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; as in this place, <hi>Set me as a Seal.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Almighty by these requests or injunctions, would affect man with the sense of his duty, that he himself is the great Lord that may command, and Man his Servant and Vassal that ought to be commanded, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever since he is pleased so far to condescend, as to request, that he be not deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, especially giving such reasons for it, which will melt any ingenuous heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That since his heart without this impression or seal, is but a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,<note place="margin">Isa. 58.4.</note> and <hi>the hand a fist of iniquity,</hi> that he would not resist the means to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both; but that when he speaks outwardly by his Word, he may be heard; and when inwardly by his Spirit, by sweet, secret, and gentle motions, he be not delayed, and put off: Two things are necessary, <hi>doceri &amp; juvari,</hi> to be taught, to be help't; God hath done both; taught us by his Word, help't us by his Spirit; nor externally, nor internally is he wanting to us; to consent lies in us.</p>
                  <p>Take these Exhortations then as spoken to those who are not yet effectually called, and so they are necessary to teach them their debt and duty; what they are by nature, and what God desires they should be. By nature without any seal of goodness at all, and now God desires they would receive his image; but take them as spoken to men already sealed, and so it is good advice, <hi>that they grieve not his Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 4 30.</note> when he comes to set <hi>his Seal</hi> upon them; but that they be content he be set upon their heart as an undelible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Seal, that may not at any time be defac'd or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:200414:198"/>
                  <p>I shall yet more fully open unto you my meaning. You see here he brings the Seale, as ready to do his office; Grace he offers, if you will. Let not us then refuse, or be unwilling to be sealed; it were our part to invite him; now that he is come, and makes a request to us, it were a base ingratitude to delay him, or shift him off. An argument rather it were of an honest heart to dispose our selves, and work out souls as wax against his coming. If your heart be hard and obdurate, as good offer him a flint to seale, which can take no print. If your hand be wicked, as good offer him a Deed to seale that is sealed already, and therefore incapaple of this holy impression. A willing, a soft heart, and an honest hand is the matter alone upon which he desires to be set. Refuse him in these, and you offer unto him an indignity.</p>
                  <p>Shall I but minde you of that Seale which he hath set upon you already? the very Natural Law which he stamp'd in yours and all mens hearts, is the inscription of this Seale, Do as you would be done to. Ask not then,<note place="margin">Psal. 4.7.</note> as they in the <hi>Psalm, Who will shew us any good;</hi> for <hi>signatum est,</hi> the light of his countenance is sealed upon us. For Moral actions we have light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from the Lamp of Reason, provided we can but keep this print fair; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Again, on the hand we have a Seale of his also. For there is in every man a Natural dexrerity to this or that profession; in one to the plough, in another to the book, in him to the sword, in that man to the shop, which the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were wont to try in their children by putting several sorts of instruments into their hands, and look what the childe made choise of, to that profession they put him.</p>
                  <p>Would men then but follow <hi>ducem Naturam,</hi> men would be better skilful in all professions Arts and Trades. For this profession and ingenuity in Nature is a Seale of the Spirit. And well it were that parents would observe it, and as their children are bent and enclined, so to endeavour to have it set upon the hand. There would much disorder in the life of man, and many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies be amended by it.</p>
                  <p>This by the way. For there be higher matters he calls for by his <hi>Pone me.</hi> It is your Sanctification, it is your Conversion, which because it cannot be done without him, let every one of us pray <hi>Veni Creator,</hi> Come holy Ghost; Oh thou sweet breath of God, breath upon my heart, that I may be able to fulfil this thy desire. It was the desire of the Spouse, and we shall do well to joyn with her, <hi>Arise O North, and come O South,</hi>

                     <hi>and blow upon my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that the spices thereof may flow forth.</hi> All those inward pangs, all godly meditations, all grave exhortations, all pathetical Sermons, all good books that ever ye looked into, are but sweet gales of this winde, by which ye drive on gently toward heaven. You never saw a dropping eye, or a bedew'd cheeke for him, but when the winde sate in this corner. First, there was a <hi>fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit Spiritus,</hi> then a <hi>flevit Maria.</hi> The Spirit first blew, and the blast begot this showre.</p>
                  <p>And after this showre how sweet Gods garden smells! <hi>fluunt aromata ejus,</hi> the spices thereof flow forth; Not a tree which is not loaden with its fruits, nor a root which shoots not into a flowre, as ambitious to send a sweet savour into the nostrils of the Almighty.

                  <p>Even in the most hopeful garden till this winde blow, the plants seeme to be dead and withered as in the down-look of winter, the herb Grace of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Faith, Humility, Obedience, put not forth one whit. But upon the rising of this gracious gale, the fruits of the spirit begin to knit; and if it blow long,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:200414:199"/> and continue, you shall see <hi>Ver erit aeternum,</hi> the garden will be in its prime and glory. Faith loaden with good works, humility pressed to the earth with her burden of patience, obedience and charity bear their expected fruits, not one enspired vertue sterile or barren.</p>
                  <p>But thus it befals them alone who are diligent to observe when this winde blows. For the Spirit, that stirs up in thee good motions to day, will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes strive with thee.<note place="margin">Jo. 3 8.</note> This winde bloweth when and where it listeth, and therefore it is uncertain whether thou shalt have the like impressions. Or if they be granted,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.24.</note> it will be with more difficulty; for as God hath called, and thou hast not answered, so shalt thou call and cry and not be heard.</p>
                  <p>Willingly then, thankfully receive the blasts of this winde; suffer no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration to passe without some special notice taken of it,<note place="margin">Isa. 40.31.</note> and then thou shalt change thy strength, <hi>humanam in divinam,</hi> that of a man into a divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For these helps of divine grace are the enabling of our natural faculties, sent by God for that purpose, that we may more easily prosecute all religious acts. That light of Gods will sealed upon our understanding, is but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Faith, Meditation, Contemplation, by which the minde being moved, with content believes, meditates, contemplates divine Mysteries. The breath of the holy Ghost into the will, is an introduction of our hope and love, devotion and desires, with which the Will being exceedingly delighted, never rests till they be in a light flame. The Embers satisfie not, till the fire burn out.</p>
                  <p>As in a Quire, the Chaunter begins the <hi>Te Deum, We praise thee O God,</hi> and then the whole Quire comes in, and joyns with him: So when we make me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody to God in our hearts, it is God by his Spirit and his holy inspirations, that begins these religious acts;<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.19.</note> but yet it is done to that end, that we should joyne with him, and continue in these praises to the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The more too blame they then, that lay all the work upon God, and put not their own shoulder to the wheele, as if the Spirit of Christ were to do all, and they nothing at all. His part he hath done, when he hath outwardly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you by his Word, inwardly spoke to you by his Spirit. Refuse him not then in his motions. Go on cheerfully and steadily in in your devotions, rise with his name in your mouths, work with his name engraven upon your hands, close up your day with his name in your lips, lye down with his name on your hearts, so shall you show that in some part you have yielded to his request, and are ready to yield to the rest; which was it is, I shall now acquaint you, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of this Pronoune <hi>Me.</hi>

                  <p>But of you Brethren I hope better things, and that you will readily yield to this request, that you will set him on your hearts and hands; which when you do, you must remember to set him in his Law and his Gospel too; for in these his face appears most gloriously in righteousness and true holiness; and therefore he commands by <hi>Solomon, that these be bound upon thy fingers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 7.3.</note>
                     <hi>and written upon the Table of thy heart.</hi> Upon thy fingers to work by, and upon the Table of thy heart to love by; nothing is to come into thy heart and hand, which is not consonant and agreeable to this Law; for as all money receives estimation and value from the Kings Seal that is upon it; so all our works receive their worth and respect from that conformity which they carry to the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>And when you are perswaded to set Gods Law there, set it <hi>as a Seal:</hi> Writing may do much, but Sealing is far better. Any Writing that is framed by pen and ink, is done by succession of parts, and many instants of time; letter is written after letter, line after line; now a little, and then a little; and possible it is that a Writing be cancell'd, and the letters razed out; but a Seal sets the whole print in the self-same instant, all's done at once, and with the same hand; a man is not long about it; and being done, it remains in the Wax. And thus the Law of God should be stamped upon us, readily, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally, totally, constantly. All the Law, without omission of any part; for a man must not give himself a Dispensation, or seek for an indulgence for any precept. The will to obey, must be total together at once, as a Seal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed upon the heart, and ready as occasion requires: For in respect of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution it is written by parcels, or piece-meal, the precepts being to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as particular occurrences require; but as the impression of a Seal is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and lasts long; so the obedience to the Law must be constant; walk we must in it all the dayes of our life.</p>
                  <p>And if our consciences can truly testifie that thus we have set him, we have an assurance that we are sealed by his Spirit, because this ready, universal, and constant obedience flows not from any principle of the flesh; of which we ought to be ambitious ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Necessary then it is, that we set, or to speak more properly, suffer the Holy Ghost to be set on our hearts and hands, if we mean comfortab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

His Person we cannot set there, but his graces we may: Charity and Goodness are in him as in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype and Original Seal, and ought to be in us as in the Wax; increated in him, created in us; and yet so in us, as if they carried a lively impression of that stamp by which they were framed; whence, saith the Apostle, <hi>the love of God is shed abroad in your hearts by the Holy Ghost,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To collect all, the summe is, that we set the Father, Son and Holy Ghost upon our hearts; that we set him there, and him alone, and no other God; that we set his Law and his Gospel there as a Seal readily, totally, constantly, which will be assurances that we have the benefits of Christ conveyed to us under Hand and Seal. 'Tis his desire that it should be so; not set any way, or in a slight manner, as a face in water-colours; but as a Signet impressed, put case in hard Wax which is lasting; his request is, which sets me on the next point,</p>

                  <p>Our Prophet still continues in the Metaphor; and as by the <hi>Mountain</hi> he intimated the stability, continuance, and firmness of Christs Church, so also in this he fore-tells the glory and eminency of it. Far more glorious it shall be than any other Temple, either Jewish, or Heathenish; and the Truth professed by them who resort to it, as far exceeding all other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Sects, and impieties, as a Mountain that over-tops all the Hillocks round about it. You see the reason of the <hi>Trope,</hi> and it justifies our Saviours words, <hi>That it is a City set upon a Hill,</hi> whence it will follow,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.14.</note> that it cannot be hid; and thence we may as easily gather, that it must be Visible. Which doctrine we constantly maintain, though our Adversaries of <hi>Rome</hi> are pleased to defame us: And defended it must be; for how else should all Nations flow unto it? how should they call one to another, <hi>venite ascenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Come, let us ascend to the Hill of the Lord,</hi> if this Mountain, if this House did not appear? This is it then we say, that existent alwayes it is, but not in an equal glory. The question then being not of the essence of the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:200414:206"/> Church, but of the existence only, evident it is, that the distinction of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and invisible Church is but modal, which never makes a new thing, but intimates that the adjuncts of the same thing are to be considered at one time in this manner, and at another time in another. You shall understand my meaning by familiar instances: I pull in, I put forth; I clinch, I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen my hand; will any man say my hand is not the same it was before? A man retires himself out of this Congregation, and anon he appears again; is he not therefore the same man? The like may be said of the Church; in the time of trouble and persecution it hath retired; under the protection and favour of Princes, it hath come forth again; contracted it hath been by sin and heresie; dilated and opened by the gracious motions of the Spirit; and yet all the while but the same Church.</p>
                  <p>But that you may the better apprehend this point, for a main matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it, I will shew you how far we grant the Church visible; how far, and in what sence invisible.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the Catholick Church be taken in its full latitude, as it takes in Christ the Head, and whole society of Saints, partly Triumphant in Heaven, partly Militant here on earth, so it is invisible. For neither is Christ the Head now an object of our eye; nor yet from <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. For next, we say, that let the Church be taken for the true, proper, and univocal parts thereof, wrestling with flesh and blood, now here on earth, who are truly members of Christs mystical body, and these are wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible. All men knew <hi>Nathanael</hi> to be an <hi>Israelite,</hi> but that he was a true <hi>Israelite,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1.47.</note>
                     <hi>in whom there was no guile,</hi> was no object to sence, but known only to God, to whose eye the heart is clear and manifest. As men are Christians they may be seen; but that they, are elected, that his Spirit unites them to Christ, that they have faith unfained, that their works proceed from a pure heart, and a good conscience, who can pronounce, saving only the searcher of all mens hearts, who only intuitively doth know in this kinde, who are his? We can see the men, and by their fruits hope they are Gods elect; but to speak precisely, no mortal eye can discern them to be Gods Elect, but God alone: because Hypocrites and the Reprobate do many times resemble them in shew and profession. And thus much a Papist dares not deny.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The whole question lies only upon the outward state and condition of the Church. And of this the Learned of <hi>Rome</hi> affirm, that the company of Professors must be so illustrious, that it may be known to all men, living at all times, that the Church is so visible, that it is palpable, that it is as co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>spicuous as any earthly kingdome, that it may be discerned, and as it were pointed out with the finger. This their errour lies in the excess. With them then though we agree that the Church even in the external face and profession hath been and shall be alwayes known, being a Society distinct from Jews and Infidels; Yet we content our selves with a lower degree of visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: For we say, That this Society is not alwayes alike eminent, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times clouded, obscured, covered, darkned, as a house on the top of a Mountain envelop'd with a mist or a thick Fogg. This company is descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whose posterity God said, <hi>that it should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For first, The number may be small: Was it not so in the time of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah?</hi> Doth he not complain, <hi>I only am left alone?</hi> Seven thousand indeed there were, but <hi>Elijah</hi> saw them not; a seed, a remnant,<note place="margin">1 King. 19.14, 18</note> a substance in the root which every eye cannot discern; if the Church be so conspicuous, as the <hi>Romanists</hi> tell us for the number, why do they place it in the V rgin <hi>Mary</hi> alone at our Saviours passion? certainly it was not very glorious, when those one hundred and twenty were shut up, and concealed in an upper Chamber.<note place="margin">Acts 1.15.</note>

                  <p n="4">4. Lastly, Yet we affirm that there have been, and evermore shall be some Pastors and People, more or less, who even to the view of men have professed the substance and essential parts of Religion, and have openly taught the prime, necessary, fundamental Articles of saving truth, though in some secondary points carried by the stream and darkness of the Times, they might have failed and erred; yea such, who have reproved the gross Errors which Time-servers, and false Teachers brought in. This they have done, either <hi>Agendo,</hi> or <hi>Patiendo;</hi> either by their tongues or by their lives; by preaching the Truth, or dying for the Truth; so that <hi>Historians</hi> have taken notice of them.</p>
                  <p>The doubt then betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and Us, ought not to be of the Visibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, but only of the manner of the Visibility: For we both affirm it visible, but not in the same degree.

                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:200414:207"/>
                  <p>These things being premised, easie it is to answer unto that scornful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of those who flowt, and ask, Where was our Religion? Where was our Church before <hi>Luther</hi> arose? In what hole of the Earth it lurked? where for so many years it lay asleep? Foolish men! as if <hi>Luther,</hi> or any other Reformer ever went about to erect a new Church, or a new Religion: No, no, the Church of Christ never was but one, the same from the beginning to the end. If their Church then was visible, ours is also visible, because theirs and ours are both but parts of the Catholick; theirs indeed unsound, ours recovered of that unsoundness which it had contracted so long as it was remaining among them:<note place="margin">1 Kings 5.</note> As therefore <hi>Naaman, sick of his leprosie,</hi> was the same <hi>Naaman</hi> that he was, being cured, visibly the same man; so also are we yet visibly the same Church, of the same society of Christians, among them leprous, but gone from their company healed. When then was our Church visible before <hi>Luther?</hi> Why in the bosome of <hi>Rome;</hi> but unsound, and unhealthy; where is it now? in the Western Church still, visibly healed and bettered.</p>
                  <p>The state of the Church under the <hi>Roman</hi> obedience, and that part which is Reformed, is very fitly resembled to a Field over-grown with Weeds, Tares, and Cockle: Some part whereof is weeded and cleansed, some part whereof remains as it was before; which makes such a vast difference to the eye, as if it were not the same Corn: But being well considered, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the whole difference is from the Weeds which remain there, and are here taken away. Those laborious husbandmen, that in the last hundreds of years have taken pains in plucking up those rank Weeds out of the Lords Field, cannot be rightly said in doing this, either to have brought in another piece of ground, or to have changed the old seed; the Field is the same, but weeded now, and unweeded then; the Grain the same, but winnowed n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w, and unwinnowed then; and this appears, because we both hold fast still the same fundamental points, the same Creed, the same Rule of Obedience, the same Rule of Prayer, the same Sacraments, the same Canon of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>It doth not then beseem men of learning and ingenuity to object in scorn to us an Aery and Mathematical Church, consisting of certain imaginary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibilities; for our Church is no more Aery and invisible than their own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Essence the same with theirs, as the blind man, who had recovered his sight, was the same in substance he was before; no other man, but no blind man. That which we confess, is this, That the number who opposed their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, was in comparison of the opposite party, small, their authority little, and their power less; so that in regard of the prevailing Faction, which like some swelling Torrent carried all before it, they were scarce a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable party. A party yet they were, who with <hi>Elijah, and his</hi> 7000. <hi>never bowed to Baal;</hi> and because they were but a small party, it gave occasion to some Divines to say our Church was invisible. The parts of this Church, whether visible, or invisible, in the sense before belongs to the Catholick Church, of which we have an evident prediction in this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Prophet addes,</p>

                  <p>The first property of Gods people ye have heard, their delight, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, their readiness, and alacrity they took to serve God.

                  <p>Their love to God was great, evident it is by their ready and cheerful confluence. But this their piety had not extinguished their charity to men; Nor indeed must it; <hi>for if a man love God, he will love his Neighbour also.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.21.</note> In the things of the world men are allow'd to be proprietaries; for many things there are which are so our own, that we need not call others to share with us.

                     </gap>; of which he that hath his share, shall have ne're the less, though another partakes with him. And therefore it is a charitable and a pious deed to exhort, to call on, to incite others to take a part with us. And this minde you shall finde to be in all good Christians, to draw as many to God as they possibly can.

                  <p>This is the cause that Gods servants have call'd upon, and call'd up one another to the performance of pious duties. <hi>Come ye children to me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>Now One the Church is said to be three ways especially.</p>

Next, in that it hath but One Head, <hi>which is Christ;</hi> under whom though there be divers guides,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.22.</note> yet they ought to be taken as one Episcopacy and Office, compacted together by a sweet connexion and coherence among themselves: Every Province acknowledging subjection and ordination to their own Primate,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.25.</note> and he to Christ.</p>

                  <p>Cursed then be they who have made a Schisme in this seamless Coat, of which those of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Sectaries are highly guilty.

                  <p>As for us, resolved we are to continue in this Mountain, and save our souls. For as out of the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> there was no safety from the flood; so out of this Mountain,<note place="margin">Gen 7.21.</note>

Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius,</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by <hi>Egena.</hi> All these were but Fictions; yet well it was, that they all agreed in this, that there was no Law so binding among men, as that which hath Divinity stamped upon it; and indeed all humane Laws can call for obedience no farther than they are consonant to the Divine;
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:200414:216"/> this may, and doth; obedience it exacts in all things; for <hi>it is the Word of the Lord,</hi> that Lord which had absolute power to command.</p>
                  <p>And there is great Reason we yield him this power, this right, and title of a Law-giver; for else he having planted a Common-wealth, and Church; and if he had not had power to bind them by Law and Conscience to his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, his Subjects might refuse to obey; and so he had been inferiour to other Princes, and more disorders and confusions be brought into his Church, than into any other Kingdom or Common-wealth; to prevent which, he hath left a Law in <hi>Zion,</hi> by which he will have his people governed; and that there be the greater Authority and Dignity in it, and the more awfulness and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in us unto it, every syllable in it, is <hi>Ʋerbum Domini;</hi> for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. <hi>He will teach,</hi> say these people, <hi>and he hath taught us his wayes.</hi>

It is the God of Truth who hath sent him, if he be sent at all: It is the God of heaven, whose Interpreter he should be: It is his Word that should be his Rule; and dare he then bring down the God of heaven, the God of truth, and make him the Author of a lye? dare he say, that his mouth hath spoken that, which never came into his mind?</p>

<q>Out of Zion shall go forth a Law.</q>

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:200414:218"/> the ground and pillar of truth; a pillar to hold out, and a stay to uphold and support the truth.</p>
                  <p>In this Church are to be found those excellent Rules and Helps for Faith and good life; those means, by the observation of which, Christian men may procure salvation. Here is to be found the truth of Religion, and the certainty thereof: Here the Oracles of God, and right interpretation of those Oracles: Here the power of the Keys, and a perpetual succession of Priests, to whose hands that power was committed: Here are the seals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, unity of Faith and Doctrine, the Communion of Saints, pardon and grace offered to sinners. In a word, warrant and security is here alone to be found from all errours in fundamental points, which are necessary to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But then this power of not erring is not to be conceiv'd, as if it were in the Church <hi>primò &amp; per se,</hi> from any thing inherent in it self: For the Church is constituted of men; and all men as men may erre: But by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative acquired, that is by the promise of Christ, <hi>that his Spirit shall lead into all truth;</hi> Besides, to teach oherwise, as our Learned and Acute Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in his answer to <hi>Fisher,</hi> hath observ'd, will impeach the Article of the Creed concerning the Holy Catholique Church;<note place="margin">Sect. 21. Num. 5.</note> whose ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness consists as much, if not more, in the verity of Faith, as in the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of manners. So that if she can erre either from the foundation, or in it, she can be no longer Holy, and that Article of the Creed is gone. For if the can erre quite from the foundation, then she is nor holy, nor Church, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an Infidel.</p>
                  <p>To that question then so much vex'd among Divines, whether the Church can erre? the Answer must be, first, by distinguishing this Notion the <hi>Church;</hi> then by reflecting upon the Object or Matter in which the Errour may lie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Church</hi> is a very ambiguous term: For the Catholique Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains not only the whole Militant Church on earth, but the whole Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in Heaven; of this last the question is not mov'd, for in that in Heaven there can be no errour. The doubt is about the Militant. Now this is again to be consider'd in the whole body, or any part of this body, which we call particular Churches; as the Church of <hi>Rome, Greece, Ephesus,</hi> and the like. And no man can doubt, or ever did doubt, till of late the Jesuite, that they may and have err'd. But for the whole body of the Militant Church, we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly acknowledge that she is Holy, though in a farre lower degree than the Triumphant, and affirm that she erres not. But then this also must have its limitation according to the object or matter, because this freedom from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour must not be extended further than Christ hath promised to defend his Church.</p>
                  <p>These Objects of Faith are the prime Articles or foundations of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and from these the whole Church on earth shall not at once make an universal defection, or do any thing by which they shall cease to be a Church. But besides these, there be many other superstructures and dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, many by and unnecessary points, and that her curiosity, or other weakness carry her beyond, or cause her to fall short of her Rule, her Law that comes from <hi>Zion,</hi> in these no man need doubt. These errours that are of a meaner allay, take not Holiness from the Church; but those which are dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in grain cannot consist with Holiness, of which the faith in Christ is the foundation.</p>

                  <p>Suppose then she were, as she layes her claim, infallible, and could not erre; yet it might not be further extended or granted than fundamentals, or doctrines absolutely necessary to salvation, because the promise of <hi>assistance,</hi> and Christs <hi>presence</hi> to the Universal Church is assured no further.

The names shall not offend, nor yet affright any sober man, whether the Church shall propose them or impose them, as Acts of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Decrees, Constitutions, Canons, Traditions, or under any other Title.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That they be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, agree with the written Word of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they have the Testimony of the Church in the prime Age there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and descend to our dayes by an unterrupted succession in the Catholique Church; but <hi>pari pietatis affecta,</hi> to receive them with equal veneration with the Scriptures, or relie upon them for as firm a direction for our Faith or good life, as upon that which we know to be the Rule, we dare not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they fall far short of those conditions, which are required in that which in this case ought to be the Rule.</p>
                  <p>There is but one Faith by which men attain salvation; to which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a firm assent of the mind; and to this the mind will never assent, till it be inform'd by a Rule, which must have these five properties.</p>
                  <p>First, It must be infallible, and most undoubtedly certain; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Faith built upon it might deceive.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It must be plaine and easie to all sorts of men, which use the meanes, are diligent in attending it, and to whom God gives eyes to see it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It must be Universal, that it instruct, not in some only, but in all points of Faith that are necessary to be known, to make the man of God perfect.</p>
                  <pb n="426" facs="tcp:200414:219"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, It must be equal, even, and impartial; not more inclined to favor one side than another.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It must carry with it power and Authority sufficient to convince the conscience, and from which there lies no appeal. All which properties because they in perfection belong only to the Law that came out of <hi>Zion,</hi> it remains that that Law alone be the Rule of our Faith to which we are to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, upon which we must fully relye with assurance and perswasion. I know what is brought by the <hi>Romanists</hi> to the contrary; but any man who is desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to see their Sophistry and Cavils fully Answered, may peruse the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Dr. <hi>John White</hi>'s way of the Church, which at this time I will not transcribe, because I hasten to a Conclusion, and shall have an apt opportunity to enlarge my self on this point in another place.</p>

The case is the same; Our King Christ Jesus, though absent in body, yet is able, and doth execute all his Offices, is present at the Counsels of all his Ministers, and gives life to all his own Ordinances by the power of his Spirit; why then should men talk of a Vicar-General, or of a Catholick Substitute, without whose direction and judgment nothing may be Authentical in the Church?</p>
                  <p>Let the Church be considered in its largest Extent, as it comprehends both the Militant and Triumphant, which with Christ the Head make but one body; and so the Government thereof is absolutely Monarchical, Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over it the sole Monarch, Lord, King, Judge, to give Laws, interpret, execute.

                  <p>First, We say, that they are mistaken, who judge and form the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church out of Reasons drawn from Nature, or principles of Art▪ For let it be out of doubt, that Christ both could and would govern his Church by that form which should be best, and most profitable; yet whether this ought to be Monarchical, Aristocratical, or Democratical, or mixt, must not depend upon a speculation of our Brain, but upon the institution of Christ himself; He is to prescribe the best way to us, and not we to prescribe to him. Now it becomes them to shew, where, when, and in what place it appears that Christ hath ordained any One man to be the Head of the Church, an Universal Bishop, a sole Monarch, his Vicar; or else their Argument drawn from Monarchy, as the best Form of Government, is of no strength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it appears not, that that which seems best to us, seemed best to him: That position of <hi>Harding</hi> is most sound; <hi>it belongs to Christ only to appoint his Ʋicar;</hi> but that he hath appointed the Pope alone, rests upon them to prove,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.18.

One Sun, and One Moon, a Pope and an Emperour all the World over? For the reason for u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting and Heading the multitude makes for One, as well as the other; which is indeed for neither: For be it that a Monarchy is the best Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in one City or Countrey, as a particular King over the Republique of Bees in every Hive; yet it follows not, that it is the best in respect of the whole World, where the parts are so remote, and the dispositions of men so various;<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Rom.

                  <p>First, It shall be easily granted, that Christ hath founded a visible Church with all helps necessary to salvation, particularly with sufficient means to beget and conserve Faith, to maintain Unity, to compose Shismes, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and condemn Heresies, and to determine all Controversies in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which were necessarily to be determined.<note place="margin">Eph. 4.11.</note> And to this end <hi>he gave A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, Prophets, Doctors, Evangel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> disputing against the <hi>Swingfeldian,</hi> where he requires two conditions to a Rule, <hi>viz. That it be certain, and made known:</hi> For if it be not <hi>certain,</hi> it is no Rule; and if it be not <hi>known,</hi> it is no Rule to us. But by his own confession there is nothing more certain, nothing better known than the Scripture; therefore it is the Rule of Catholique Faith, both in it self, and to us also; being in things sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply necessary to salvation, abundantly known and manifest. In things Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, I say: For in those that are not Necessary, a man may abound in his own sence, and do himself no harm; provided, that he be of a meek and a peaceable spirit, diligent to inform his conscience, and constant to follow it. And this is the comfort that St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives such a man, with this Caveat,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. <hi>à.</hi> 10. ad 15.</note>
                     <hi>To take heed how he builds upon the foundation:</hi> His desire is, that nothing be laid upon it but <hi>gold, silver, precious stones;</hi> that is, sound Doctrine; but if it be through ignorance and infirmity, <hi>wood, hay, stubble,</hi> heterodox stuff, <hi>This mans work shall be burnt, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not then Necessary that a Visible Judge be appointed to end all the Controversies that fall out in Religion. And their Argument fetcht from the great necessity of Judges in Civil and Criminal causes is very fallacious, there being a great disparity betwixt these, as is clearly shew'd by Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>

                  <p>His last Argument is, That for the ending of Civil Controversies, that Judges be appointed and known. So likewise saith he, If our Saviour had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that all Controversies in Religion should be by some visible Judge finally determined, who can doubt, but in plain terms he would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed himself about this matter? He would have said plainly, The Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> I have appointed to decide all emergent Controversies. For that our Saviour should design the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to this Office, and not cause it to be written by any Evangelist or Apostle, but leave it to be drawn out of uncertain principles by streins of Logique and Philosophy, <hi>Credat Judaeus apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, non ego.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, suppose there were a living Judge, and the Pope were the man, yet such is the malice of the Devil, and of impious men, that this would not be enough to keep the Church from renting at all times, or soder up the rents which are made in the Doctrines of Faith: For doth not the Apostle inform us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.19.</note>

It seems the Popes power is beyond that of the chief Apostle; and he can do more with one Decree, than <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> could do by their Commission. But if his decision be of such vertue, that all the Beasts of the Forest must tremble at the roaring of the Lyon, I wonder that he should be either so uncharitable or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to suffer such heats and contentions among his own at home?

                  <p>Well then, to resume the question, is there no way left to end and decide Controversies arising in Religion? Yes certainly; and to that end God hath appointed two kind of Judges,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Whites</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. c. 4. Sect. 2.</note> as that Learned Bishop hath taught me in his Orthodox.: The sum of whose discourse is this:</p>
                  <p>First, The one Supream and Independent, whose sentence is infallible; this Judge is the Holy Ghost, who delivers an open and visible sentence in the Scripture in all things necessary to salvation. But besides the Holy Ghost, the Lord hath left in his Church subordinate Judges, by whose Wisdom and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:200414:223"/> Controversies of Religion are to be debated and defined. And these Judges are of two sorts. First, general, for the whole Church, namely the Fathers lawfully Assembled, and proceeding in a general Council. Or else particular, the chief Fathers of each Provincial or National Church: both which are bound in their judgement in all supernatural verity to proceed by the written Word of God, and their definition delivered according to this Rule is Authentical and infallible, and ought to be obey'd principally for the matter so declared, which hath its Authority from the Scripture in which it is contain'd, and to which it is consonant: But then Secondly, because it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and published by Pastours and Teachers, by Governours and Rulers, whom God hath made the Stewards of his Family, and to whom he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Keys of his spiritual Kingdom. And because to these there is made a special promise of assistance of Grace, and a joynt labour used for the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Truth, and upon that their honest industry and unanimous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given; the Truth so declared and publish'd, must needs be of more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, than any Truth made known by private persons. But where it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that the Pastours have not proceeded by this Rule, it is nor Schisme, nor Heresie, to dissent, or to affirm, that in this or that point <hi>ampliandum,</hi> and in a peaceable way to produce solid reasons of our dissent.</p>
                  <p>I know the difficulties to which this determination is subject. But when our Adversaries have said all they can against it, the very self-same will press them, when they shall set up One infallible Judge. Be it that of the private spirit, or obscurity of Scripture, or Interpretation of Fathers, or partiality, or pride, or self-love; which a late Jesuite perceiving, delivers these words,<note place="margin">Except to the Lord <hi>Faul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I am no <hi>Socinian,</hi> nor inclining to that sort of mis-believers; yet nevertheless, I say, <hi>Right Reason must be he, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans own conscience.</hi> And of these Judges I hope every man will allow; and it is reasonably sure they ought to do so, because <hi>Reason</hi> is in all questions the <hi>last</hi> and the <hi>Interior Judge;</hi> without whose assent and approbation, no exterior is sufficient and compleat: For exterior Judges be as Spectacles to the eyes; and as Spectacles, be they never so good, cannot see without eyes; so cannot Revelation, be it never so manifest, give the last sentence about any Doctrine, nor be sufficient without Reason. What is this I reade here? what a higher Judge than he that is infallible? Reason to be set upon the Bench, and to give Judgement of the Popes definition? Reason guided aright,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now right Reason will dictate all that I have said, That Christ be the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Judge in his Church, that he be heard when he delivers his sentence by his Spirit in the Scriptures, that they then be the Rule for other men to proceed by, that in all points necessary to salvation, this Rule be plain and
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:200414:224"/> evident: That it is such, none so fit to judge as the Primitive Church, who were no way interessed in the contentions that since have risen: Thar in these late differences, the <hi>Pope</hi> of all other can be no competent Judge, because a Party. That therefore the debates be referred to a General Council-law, fully called; and that their Decisions be submitted to, from which it is then only lawful to dissent, when there is evident testimony of plain Scripture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded according to the General Tenet of godly Pastours of the precedent Church; then only it is lawful to gainsay the present definition of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Judges.</p>
                  <p>I am full as the Moon, but if I should empty my self, the Tide would flow so high, that what stuffe soever the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> hath brought upon the Church, must come to your view; their Supremacy, their Monarchy, their Infallibility, with all the Consequences, and a Volume is too little for it.

                  <p>Thus have I seen the picture of some eminent beauty drawn at first rudely, the limbs only and lineaments shaped out with a black Cole, and yet a man may say, the person, whose image it is, is a comely piece, even before the hand of the Painter hath passed upon it, draw'n it in colours to the life, or fil'd it up. Such beauty in her black lines the Spouse here had, a beauty of holiness compassed with infirmities; and therefore she makes use of a diminishing term; absolute beauty she layes no claim to, but only to comeliness, so much she durst assume to her self.

                  <p>But when a force is put upon any man to shew his own comeliness, this Caution would not be forgotten, which may be learned from the Spouse here, that first he be humbled for his blackness, before he make report of his comely features.

                  <p>And it is his grace and favour, that I do so appear. For it is the Sunne from above that hath put these sad thoughts in my heart, and these peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Ornaments upon my back. For when he enlightned me to know him, and inflamed me to love him, at the same instant he pierced my heart with a radiant beam, that I might know my own wickedness, and acknowledge my sin, mourn for it, and hate it;<note place="margin">Psa. 51.3.</note> at which time though in his eye I may be
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:200414:236"/> faire, yet to all that look upon me I am but black.</p>
                  <p>And it is his eye that blacks me; for <hi>Repentance</hi> is his gift: <hi>Now we see clearly,</hi>

But this is in none more evident, than in the conversion of St. <hi>Peter; The Lord,</hi> said the Sacred Text, <hi>turn'd about and look'd upon</hi> Peter, <hi>and then he went out and wept bitterly.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 22.61.</note> The burning flame of tentation had black'd <hi>Peter,</hi> brought him to deny and forswear the Lord of glory. Could there be likely a blacker soul? But the Sun of righteousness yet is pleased to behold him; the beams whereof toucht, and shin'd, and struck upon his heart, inflam'd and burnt him with a vehement grief and contrition proceeding from the love of his Master; and as I may so say, discolour'd him within, while it made him sad at Heart, heavy in his Countenance, and distill'd a River of salt teares from his eyes, with which he might steep and rense off his contracted swarthy hue, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the beauty of Grace which he lost. This Sun suffer'd him to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd, that it might colour him afresh; it black'd him to make him whiter, it burnt him to make him brighter: For a while it was, as I may say, ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed to him, that it might shine upon him with the more comfortable Beames.</p>
                  <p>To give you farther light about this matter; It will be worth observation, that sinners are put in a threefold difference, the men being compared to tares,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>August. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. in</hi> Mat. c. 11.</note> or chaff; to tares, which have a root in Nature quite different from the wheat; or to chaff, which with the wheat springs from the same graine and root. The first we call Infidels; the last are yet in the number of the faithful.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. These, if truly of that number, are not Coal-black, but <hi>fusci,</hi> black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish; and that face is said to be such, which hath more of blackness in it: So the faithful though they be black'd with sin, and discolour'd, having lost much of their first love, the violence of concupiscence drawing them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to sin, yet still they retain much of their Faith and Hope, they hold still to the true Religion, and so cannot be properly said to be <hi>Nigri,</hi> but <hi>Subni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gri;</hi> discoloured they are, but they are no <hi>Moors;</hi> Tawny, but not pure <hi>Aethiops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And hence may proceed another difference betwixt the faithful and the Infidels: That the profession blacks the one; but the sin, that dwells in him and cannot be shaken off, blacks the other. For the cause of this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring in the Sons of the Church, is not to be imputed to their Mother, nor to the Law, nor to the Doctrine or Rule of life, in which they are brought up: For all these are Holy, and would keep, if observ'd, her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in perfect beauty; the fault must be laid upon the heate of concupiscence, for by this they become sun-burnt: Whereas it is not this flame only of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred lust that doth bring this colour of night upon the souls of Jews, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> Heretiques, and Sectaries, but their very profession, that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth lyes, and corrupts good manners; because they worship an Idol, an imagination, a false Christ; so that the more Religious, the more black: <hi>The best of them being a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And yet there is a third difference betwixt sinners among Christians. Some mask only under the name, and others are true believers. Those sin without any remorse of conscience;<note place="margin">Psa. 7.14.</note>
                     <hi>they plot mischief, and rejoyce to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> The Sun, I mean the Son of God, seldom looks upon these; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

But <hi>David</hi> had alwayes his iniquity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he acknowledg'd his wickedness, and so bath'd away his spots: So do the true Sons of the Church, sin as <hi>David,</hi> but cry <hi>peccavi</hi> as <hi>David;</hi> and so notwithstanding their blackness, or rather a seeming staine and tincture of it, acquire so much beauty that they are Comely in Gods Eye.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle reckons up seven effects of <hi>godly sorrow;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.11.</note> among which <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>revenge</hi> are the last; to which when any penitent comes, you shall find him black enough, whether his zeal moves him to take revenge either upon himself, or else to vindicate Gods Honor.</p>

                  <p>Dissenters there are on both hands; <hi>Rome</hi> ejects all those for <hi>sons,</hi> who are not born in her womb; and the Brethren of separation will acknowledge none for children, who are not nursed up at their breasts, and dandled upon their knees: Zeal hath transported them both beyond the truth, in the midst it lies, and this it is.</p>

                  <p>But for the persons, it is not so easie to avoid, nor indeed so necessary in that sense as many strait-laced men conceive; for wicked men are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered

                  <p n="1">1. Whether the faults imputed to the <hi>Mother</hi> lie not in the wicked lives of the Priests and People;<note place="margin">Perk. in Jude.</note> if that appear, to separate is not lawful; <hi>for the Scribes and Pharisees sate in Moses seat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 23.1.</note> and yet Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>that they be heard.</hi> Many evil Priests there were in <hi>Israel,</hi> yet the people for their sakes refrained not from the Sacrifice of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether the Church erre in matter of Religion; then we must consider whether the Errour lie in a more weighty, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Doctrine, or else in some lighter or circumstantial matter.</p>
                  <p>First, If it be a matter of less importance, such as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Hey, Wood and Stubble,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.15.</note> then we may not separate; for there may salvation be had in such a Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Yea, but what if this Error lie in the foundation or substance of Doctrine; then it is easily to be considered,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whether this Errour proceed of frailty, and is defended only with a peaceable and docible mind, or else be pertinaciously and obstinately main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If upon frailty only, it may be suffered with hope that God in his good time will reveal the truth: The Church of <hi>Galatia</hi> was through frailty quickly <hi>turned to another Gospel, and erred in the foundation, expecting justification by the works of the Law.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. But if the Errour lie in the foundation, and is defended with a perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and obstinacy, then a separation may be made with a good conscience; then we need not esteem them <hi>our Mothers sons:</hi> Then that place of the <hi>Corinths</hi> out of the Prophet is aptly urged,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.17.</note>
                     <hi>Come out from among them, and be you separate;</hi> and that counsel which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives <hi>Timothy, If any man teach otherwise,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.5.</note>

Yet before we may pass this harsh censure of obstinacy and pertinacy upon any Church, it is necessary that there be not a proud and rash, but an humble and prudent Examination of the Doctrine; not a heady, factious and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but a discreet, legal and peaceable conviction: Lastly, not the Vote of private men, but a grave Censure of a lawful assembled Synod.</p>
                  <p>This being the naked truth, doth easily discover the weakness and rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those Zelots who have departed from <hi>our Mother,</hi> and separated from her children; for who can with a good conscience fasten this upon the Church of <hi>England?</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Acuti, amari, difficiles,</hi> sharp, bitter, implacable people: The first of these sting as Bees, the second as Wasps, the third as Hornets: The first burns as fire in stubble, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond glowes as fire in Iron, the third lives long as fire raked up in Embers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first are a sort of Cholerique men, who have a great bag of gall, and yellow choler, into which an occasion of anger falling by chance, is as a spark that lights in powder, that presently rises in your face. The ground of sudden heat is commonly envy, emulation, grudging, which hath for its obiect the prosperous and flourishing estate of another. This
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:200414:241"/> fills men to the eyes, and in the eyes it sits, and by those windows it looks forth, and wheresoever it sees a blessing, displeas'd it is, if God do not curse. The Elder Brother in the Gospel, when he heard <hi>melody and dancing in his Fathers house,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 15.28.</note> and heard of the <hi>Ring, and Robe, and fat Calf killed by the Father to welcome home his lost son, he was angry at the matter, and would not go in.</hi> Thus far go the <hi>Acuti,</hi> even good-natur'd men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the second sort are far worse, those <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or <hi>Amari,</hi> who have an equal share of black and yellow choler; Men that are not very soon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, nor yet very soon pleased: As their heat is longer kindling, so it is longer ere it go out; much like Old Rotten Wood, which once on fire, will burn Day and Night. This commonly ends in malice and bitterness.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But yet these bitter men, are not half so bad as those who are <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, who have more splene than gall; that once angry, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be pacified. In them the cold <hi>Saturnine</hi> humour is not apt to be heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet as cold water it may be made to boyle, and then scalld as much as fire.

                  </p>
                  <p>Of which kinde of these angry people the Spouse here speaks, it is not easie to determine, since Translators differ, and the effects differ also: For some reade <hi>inflammati,</hi> some <hi>incensi;</hi> the vulgar goes farther, <hi>pugnaverunt.</hi> It puts me to think, that the Church might have many ungracious discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Sons, all Opponents to their Mother, yet upon different occasions; some who upon envy, some who on malice, some who on pride, were inflam'd against her.</p>
                  <p>Her Prosperity and Dowry was the object of their envy; Her Discipline and Order, of their malice and bitterness; Her Officers or Prelates, of their tumour and pride. Their pride was such, that it suggested a Parity; their malice so great, that it call'd for an Anarchy; their envy so blinded, that it dreamed of a Community. Against which whatsoever they saw in practice, made them angry, inflam'd them, incens'd them, brought them to be implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>they fought.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How little reason there was for her Children to be angry for her Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, Orders, or Constitutions, with her Officers and Prelates, I shall shew at large in a discourse by it self. At this time I shall only justifie her Dowry and Maintenance.</p>
                  <p>This was conferr'd upon her, either by the bounty of Princes and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; or else by the indulgence of Heaven. The first was a free gift, and voluntary; she layes no claim to it, till it was given; for <hi>while it was their own,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 5.4.</note>
                     <hi>was it not in their own power?</hi> They might have kept it without sinne at pleasure. But being once given, <hi>Justinian</hi> tells us, that God was the proprietary, the Goods were his; <hi>&amp; quae in Dei sunt bonis, over that which is Gods, man can have no power;</hi> and therefore can not alienate them, nor take them away.</p>
                  <p>The Dowry which God made over unto her, was Tithes: In that he had right. Right indeed he hath to all; but he is content we enjoy the Nine parts; conditionally, we pay the Tenth to him. In the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> he layes his claim,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.8.</note>
                     <hi>All Tithes are mine;</hi> and upon it he calls for payment, <hi>Bring in all Tithes into my store-house;</hi> where he assignes the <hi>Priest</hi> to be his <hi>Receiver;</hi> and is very angry when they are with-held; <hi>Will a man spoile his God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men are very much mistaken, when they conceive a Tenth to be paid as a meere stipend to the Priest: They should look further, and remember it
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:200414:241"/> is Gods Tribute, his due debt, an offering of Thanksgiving and gratitude, for blessing the whole Harvest. And is the Priests no other way than by Gods Assignation, he Ordaining that he should receive it in his Name, and take it for his wages, for doing his work.</p>
                  <p>This Dowry was not denyed our Mother in the Law of Nature;<note place="margin">Gen. 14.20. Gen. 28.22.</note>

That which I intend to inferre out of these or the like Testimonies, for they are many, is this, That in the judgement of the Heathen the Tenth was Gods part; that Reason taught them to pay it, and they did pay it to their Gods; that their Priests received it, employed it to Divine uses, and were maintained by it. So that it is not a portion due by a positive Law only, but by a Dictate of Natural Reason.</p>
                  <p>I have reserv'd Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Argument to the last, as that in which there is the greatest force, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2, 6. The Apostle is to prove <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck</hi> to be a <hi>Priest,</hi> and a greater <hi>Priest</hi> than <hi>Levi.</hi> His <hi>Mediums</hi> to induce those conclusions are two; <hi>Melchizedecks</hi> Benediction and Decimation of <hi>Abraham; He blessed him; ergo,</hi>

                  <p>Whether it were the Spoyles, or all the Spoyles, or the Spoyles alone, or of all his goods (though it is most likely to be of this last;) for <hi>vers.</hi> 2. The Apostle saith, <hi>He gave a tenth part of all:</hi> and after addes, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>That he gave even the tenth of the Spoyles;</hi> that over and above, I dispute not; for it is enough to my purpose, that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that out of right he tith'd <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> be they tenth of spoyles or other Goods.</p>
                  <p>For out of this Apostolical Logique it seems to me, that to Tithe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Tithes, belongs to the Priesthood <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This plea here put in for my Mothers Dowry, would I know, have been censur'd at another time as treading too much inward; but since he that puts it in, hath no benefit by it, nor is like to have, I hope it will receive the more candid interpretation, as proceeding, which it doth, from a love to Truth, and not to any Interest. And I hope, that they who were wont to cry so loud against our Mothers Dowry, will not take this plea in ill part, since now they live and thrive upon it, and grow thereby as faire and fat, and well liking as any of her former Children.

               <p>To collect all, an Ordination they had then, an Ordination we have now; by Bishops only then, by Bishops only now; imposition of hands used then, imposition of hands used now; by which there was a power given to execute some special Acts, which now only our Bishops can execute; and therefore why are not our Prelates in Office and Nature the same with theirs?</p>
               <p>Two peculiars were especially reserv'd to them; power to Ordain, and power to Rule; which our Prelates justly vindicate as their own.</p>

               <p>I have been I confess too tedious upon this point, but it is no more than needs; for it removes the exceptions, which may be put in to dissuade obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to those that now Rule; for they carry the same names that they did, they are ordained in the same manner that they were, they assume to themselves no greater power than those Ancient Bishops had, either in Ordinations of Priests or Deacons, or for giving precepts for comeliness, and order in Gods worship; or else in hearing, conventing, sentencing, and correcting Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Mandate for obedience, must now be of force as well as when he gave it.</p>
               <p>'Tis a saucy speech then of any mutinous <hi>Corah</hi> to come and tell his <hi>Aaron</hi> he takes too much upon him, when he assumes neither other Name or Power than the Scripture warrants, and the practice of the Church confirms; and yet there be who hold it a point of conscience to resist.

Why must theirs be necessary, and ours left loose and at Randome? <hi>Sana consilia,</hi> good counsel only, and for every man to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace or cast off at his pleasure. Is it, that there is more authority to prove theirs than ours? I suppose that when all's done, <hi>Omnia decenter, &amp; in ordine,</hi> must bear the burden of both sides.</p>
               <p>Those that have wrested the Scripture that way, could never yet finde what they aim'd to collect from thence, farther than by poor and marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous slight conjectures. The Father of the Consistory could never conclude in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in every particular circumstance from Scripture what he desired; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially he confesseth the Platforme he drew, might be there contain'd, but actually he knew it was not. And therefore all he desired of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches, was no more than a Declaration that his Discipline was conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant unto the Word of God, without any qualifications, cautions, ifs, or ands. And their answer was as modest, that it was a Godly Ordinance
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:200414:252"/> drawing toward the prescript of Gods Word; that it was there contained, nor he desired, nor they determined.</p>
               <p>Was it not strange then that he at his first admission should bind the whole City with a Solemn Oath to live in obedience to such Solemn and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Constitutions as the Consistory should ordain;<note place="margin">Idem. pag. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> and a second time after his Revocation from Banishment renew this Oath again?<note place="margin">Idem. pag. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> We are accused to lay a snare upon mens consciences, and to confine into narrow bounds Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, when we say that these Rites and Ceremonies are to be observed in Gods Worship, and settle such a Form of Aristocracy in the Church, which may be easily proved by the perpetual practice of the Church in all Ages, enjoyning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours to obey the Constitutions of those whom God hath set over them; and yet he which laid his burden upon their necks with the strictest Bond that man can be bound in, with the Bond of a double Oath, was never yet impeached for incroaching upon Christian liberty; it seems he might do what we may not, and yet with the person the case is quite and clean altered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the truth is, nor we, nor he can violate any mans Christian liberty, nor take from that liberty with which <hi>Christ hath made us free,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.2.</note> a place by that side pressed very much to this purpose; but will it thence follow, that we may not be commanded to obey an Ecclesiastical Constitution conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Gods Word? Or if we be commanded, that then our Christian-liberty is trampled upon?</p>
               <p>Never any sound Expositour that wrote upon that Text yet thought so; the liberty of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> there speaks, was from the observation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical Law, out of a Jewish opinion of Justification to arise from thence: Those Ceremonies then by Christ antiquated, were not to be pressed upon any mans conscience, as observations necessary to salvation; for in that sense they were <hi>mortiferae;</hi> Circumcision, or any other Rite used to that end, made a man a Debtor to the whole Law, and evacuated the vertue of Christs blood. Should any Jewish Proselyte urge the Observation of a Mosaical Rite unto that end, here a new Convert might plead his Christian liberty, stand upon it; and he that should go about to bow his neck to <hi>Moses</hi> yoke, was to be accounted an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to his freedom which he had in Christ. Now what makes all this to withdraw obedience from Church-constitutions, in things indifferent in their own nature, imposed by a lawful Authority? Men must not be forced to observe <hi>Moses</hi> Law, therefore not the precepts of those that Rule; that is against Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore this, <hi>Arena sine Calce.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> Did ever any press these as a necessary means of Justification, or a way to purge and abolish sin? Cannot a man be a partaker of that liberty which he hath in Christ, which is a freedom from the Curse of the Law, and the Dominion of Sin, and yet observe Church-consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions! It behoves those men who with such zeal press the Commandment, <hi>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain,</hi> to take heed, lest by putting false glosses upon Gods Word, they be not guilty in a high manner of the breach of this precept.</p>
               <p>Yea, but say some of them, let these things remain as they are in their own nature, indifferent things, left to every mans judgment to observe, or not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, and not to be made necessary; and we will submit; marry when they are imposed upon us with the opinion of necessity, a burden they prove, and tye the conscience (which is free from every Bond, except it be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Gods Law) to a necessary obedience of the Traditions of men.</p>

                  <p>But I rather conceive that their power was usurped,<note place="margin">Loc. cit.</note> and that they did what they should not; as in a corrupt state there be that invade that power which belongs to their Superiours, by vertue of which they do such acts which they should not, which yet being done are of force, though the Doer cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for after; <hi>factum valet, fieri non debuit.</hi>

                  <p>This Objection shall receive its answer out of <hi>Calvins instit. cap. de fide. Sect.</hi> 50.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That it was certain none of the Laity, but the Pastors only did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose hands; but whether divers of them did it, or one chiefly among them, is uncertain; notwithstanding <hi>Manus Presbyterii</hi> in this place, yet <hi>Calvin</hi> is resolute, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> only, and no other imposed hands upon <hi>Timothy;</hi> and his proof is 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Stir up the grace of God in thee, by the putting on of my hands,</hi> signanter, <hi>my hands;</hi> and therefore it was not necessary that in the Creation of <hi>Timothy</hi> a Bishop there should be Presbyters admitted to his Ordination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> By <hi>Presbyterium</hi> is to be understood, not <hi>persona,</hi> but <hi>munus;</hi> not the persons that did ordain, but the Office to which <hi>Timothy</hi> was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; so <hi>Calvin</hi> understands it, <hi>Manum Presbyterii, non de seniorum colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio, sed ordinationem ipsam intelligo, quasi diceret, Fac ut gratia,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But if we shall understand with the Ancient Expositors, <hi>personam,</hi> not <hi>munus;</hi> then <hi>Presbyterium</hi> in this place, is no more than <hi>Collegium Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum,</hi> or <hi>totus Presbyteratus ordo,</hi> which I mentioned before, who might assist, and impose hands together with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Timothy;</hi> and yet that these were of no higher order than Presbyters, will not be so evident out of the name, as shall by and by appear.</p>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:200414:255"/>
                  <p>They object in the second place, <hi>against the institution of Bishops, that they are not of Divine Ordinance; that Munus ejus est humano sensu in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductum, Calv. Sect.</hi> 52. and to this purpose, <hi>Hierom</hi> is alledged, <hi>Noverint Episcopi se magis consuetudine, quam Dominicae dispositionis veritate Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris esse majores.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. As I have shewed before, their institution was in the Apostles, and their Ordination <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Acts 1. by our Saviour himself, <hi>John</hi> 20. They were not then <hi>humano sensu in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Church hath ever had them, and honoured them by that name, as is evident by all Ecclesiastical Stories, and Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That Tradition, were it no more, which hath antiquity, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality, and consent of Scripture to speak for it, is more than humane; and such is this; for so ancient it is, that the institution appears not in any Council, nor indeed can it, because it came from Christs example, and from the Apostles dayes hath been so universally received, that in the Patriarchal Seas the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of the first Bishops are yet extant; and to is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to <hi>posuit vos Spiritus Sanctus Episcopos;</hi> to the seven Angels of the seven Churches in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> &amp;c. I know not therefore why man only should be said to be the Author.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Farther, the Apostles practised what our Saviour began, ordained Bishops to succeed them, as I proved before; and if <hi>Calvin</hi>'s own Rule be true touching the Ceremony of imposition of hands, <hi>Licet nullum extet praeceptum de manuum impositione, quia vero fuisse in perpetuo usu Apostolis videmus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Loc. cit. sect. <hi>50.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>illa tam accurata eorum observatio praecepti vice nobis esse debet;</hi> then it will follow that Bishops are not <hi>humano sensu inducti;</hi> but that there is as strong a proof for their institution as a precept amounts to, because it was in <hi>perpetuo usu Apostolis,</hi> as I now made good; <hi>Traditio Apostolica toti orbi manifesta,</hi> as <hi>Iraeneus</hi> calls it, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, True it is that poor <hi>Hierom</hi> hath been pitifully lased for his hasty words; <hi>Michael Medina</hi> fetched blood at <hi>Trent,</hi> when he enrolled him for this with <hi>Aerius</hi> in the Catalogue of Hereticks; but he might have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the good old father; for the good mans meaning was not with <hi>Aerius,</hi> to remove out of the Church the order of Bishops; (for he establisheth their power in divers places, and maintains that they are necessary in the Church for avoiding of Schismes) he doubted only <hi>quo jure</hi> they exercised their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whether <hi>Consuetudine Ecclesiae,</hi> or <hi>Divinae dispositionis veritate;</hi> and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively resolves for the Negative, in which he is to be blamed; if his words be not to be mollified by Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi>'s interpretation, <hi>Perp. Gov. of the Ch. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>pag.</hi> 236. The truth is, he was a Presbyter only, and no Bishop; (<hi>Arrius</hi> and <hi>Aerius,</hi> and <hi>Valentinius</hi> stomached that others were above them, men of less deserts, as they conceived) it might be <hi>Hierom</hi>'s case; and if not so, yet we know that he was too much addicted to a Monastical life, and displeased with <hi>John</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> who as other Bishops, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drew forth some marks to the service of the Church from their Cloysters; this perchance moved <hi>Hierom</hi>'s blood, whom the World knew to be of a cholerick nature, and in his heat he easeth his spleen, <hi>Noverint Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, But were not this so, but that he spake in cool blood, what reason is there to believe his single word before a full Jury of Orthodoxal Fathers, in whom they might have read presently after our Saviours Ascension,<note place="margin">Vid. Winch. opusc. pag. <hi>170.</hi>

                  <p>But what now if out of these very words of <hi>Hierome,</hi> it will appear that Bishops were ordain'd in the Apostles dayes? <hi>Antequàm,</hi> saith he, <hi>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Out of which words I thus argue: When Shismes began, and one said, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> then were the Churches committed to the chief care and pre-eminent charge of one; But these Schismes arose in the Apostles time; therefore. And this one was a Bishop by <hi>Jeroms</hi> confession. And out of Ecclesiastical story it is evident, who this one was in the Patriarchal Seas.

                  <p>Thirdly, They Object, <hi>That no Argument can conclude for Bishops from the name</hi> Episcopus, <hi>because that the name of</hi> Episcopus <hi>and</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>in the Scripture are promiscuously used; and to this purpose they all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Resp.</hi> We answer, that <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an Argument that sets a good face on the matter, and hath no substance in it, because <hi>quaedam dicuntur de, sed non insunt in.</hi> And therefore as we do not conclude that there were Bishops in the Apostles times, because there were that bore the name; so neither can they conclude, that these Bishops were no more than Presbyters, because they were call'd Presbyters. The truth is, that though they might communicate in name, yet they were two really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Offices, which we prove from their power of Ordination, of jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them reserv'd, and not from the names; or at least that if there were not <hi>in Ordine Episcopali novus character, certe character Presbyteralis extensior, vel major factus nova manuum impositione.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That their names were confounded we grant: for B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Resp.</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> answers this Objection, that though now to do it were absurd; now, when <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Such was the love, and humility, and unity, and alacrity in the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of those times, to discharge the Office to which they were call'd, that the Bishop upon the highest staire, would descend, and submit, if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to execute the Office; not only of the Presbyter, but even of the very Deacon too. Then according to our Lords direction, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Secondly, A second <hi>Rod</hi> yet there is, and it is the <hi>Shepherds Pastoral,</hi> by which every wandering Sheep is reclaim'd from the wrong, and directed the right way.

                     <item>1. In whose hand the <hi>Rod</hi> is.</item>

               <p>First, The <hi>Rod</hi> is in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, an Apostle, a Clergy-man; the Pronoune <hi>Ego</hi> here appropriates to him: For it is not likely that he would terrifie them with that power he had not. This <hi>Rod</hi> in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, is all one with the Key in Saint <hi>Peters;</hi> there was the same use of it in both. By this the chief Apostle might shut out, and let in; with this the least Apostle might whip out such as deserv'd it.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To them this power was <hi>promised;</hi> by name to <hi>Peter, Tibi dabo claves;</hi> but in him to all the Apostles, <hi>Petrus gessit Ecclesiae personam; quae ergo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta</hi> Petro, <hi>dicta universae Ecclesiae,</hi> August. in Psal. 108.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssion of sinne,</hi> injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pennance</hi> and <hi>Absolution:</hi> So careful our Saviour was before he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted so great power into their hands, to make them capable of it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this their Commission temporary, or to last only for the Apostles dayes; because when they had run their races, there would be as great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as liv'd in their dayes, who would have as great need of the grace of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi> and <hi>Indulgence</hi> from the Priests Hand, as they could have. As Priests then, and not as Apostles, they receiv'd this power; to last for ever, as the Gospel which they preached was to be <hi>aeternum Evangelium,</hi> Rev. 14.6. to endure for ever; and therefore to be a perpetual Legacy to their Successours. But in their places none but Priests succeed them, and therefore none but Priests can succeed them in their power and function. The Commission to loose and binde, was granted to none but to them and their Successors; and therefore it may be executed by none but by them and their Successors. In their Hands it is, and solely in theirs, in <hi>fieri,</hi> in <hi>esse,</hi> in <hi>conservari,</hi> in <hi>operari.</hi> Let them then in Gods name, quietly enjoy, what by Original grant is theirs.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows that a Lay-man, <hi>qua talis,</hi> how eminent soever, nor yet any Corporation of Lay-Elders how godly soever, may wrest this Rod out of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Hand; no, nor yet by any means be invested with, much less arrogate to himself this power, because it is a prerogative annex'd to the power of Order.</p>
               <p>But this you will say may easily be granted, that a Clergy-man, and none but a Clergy-man, hath the power of the Rod; the question is, whether he may not delegate this power unto a Lay-man; by vertue of which delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Lay-m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To which I answer first, that our Saviour did it not; to the Apostles on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he committed this power, and not to any Laique; now his actions ought to be presidents, nay precepts to all following cases.</p>
               <p>Next, no man ought to conferre a Grace upon that man of which he is not capable; and of this grace, as I have sufficiently proved, no Lay-man is,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:200414:262"/> in that he is not <hi>inspired,</hi> in that he is not sent; and therefore since he hath not the former grace of <hi>sending,</hi> he may not execute the latter of <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>loosing;</hi> either the Bishop must send him, and inspire him by Ordination, or else he cannot give him a Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That a Lay-man may be deputed by the B shop <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> or <hi>contentioso,</hi> to hear and decide such cases, I deny not; I question only whether he hath power to excommunicate. Their distinction then may serve them to prove their right of Trial, but not their power of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Yea, and their very practice evinceth so much; for grant that the party who hath a case to be tryed in the Court, obey not the Monition and Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, for this he is pronounced <hi>contumax,</hi> and so proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst; but by what Key? <hi>ordinis,</hi> or <hi>jurisdictionis?</hi> Not by the latter, for that hath his use only as they teach, <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> where <hi>Lis</hi> is <hi>decernen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and his Contumacy is not of that nature.

                  <p>It is our fate to have liv'd in an age of discords, Men having such inharmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:200414:270"/> souls, that the melody of <hi>Zion</hi> sounds worse in their ears than the hoarse noats of the croaking Ravens. The musick of Harps, Viols, Organs, Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and lowder Instruments, used in the service of God; is as pleasing in their heavy ears, as the braying of an <hi>Arcadian</hi> beast. Beyond a plain Psalm (which some will not allow neither) to sing praise, is in their judgement a Popish, a Superstitious, an unlawful custom. And would not this bring a sad thought of the waters of <hi>Babylon?</hi> cause a man to sit down there and weep <hi>when he remembers thee O Zion!</hi> Thee O <hi>Zion,</hi> in which the Lords songs were wont to be sung with sweetest voices, and Instruments of <hi>David!</hi> Thee O <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in which <hi>Te Deum laudamus, Maries Magnificat, &amp; Zacharies Benedictus,</hi> and the Angels <hi>Glory to God on high,</hi> did make a strange impression on an humble, faithful, thanful, fervent heart, and sometimes fetch tears from the eye of a contrite spirit! And that there was no error in this, shall appear by these solid Reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To scare us from this heavenly melody, with the formidable <hi>Mormo</hi> of Roman Superstition, and will-worship, as if we were yet children in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in Antiquity, in Reason, is an over confident attempt; <hi>Non obtusa adeo gestamus pectora.</hi> For what is there Popery, Superstition, Will-worship practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in heaven? There St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> doubts not to affirm, that the Angels sing all the Hymns with us; that it is little better than fury to throw this piece of heaven out of the Church. Or grant, that in the <hi>Revelation</hi> (where there is so often mention made of this heavenly musick) the Church below on earth is to be understood, then the Argument is stronger. For then it will follow undeniably, that it may be done here. Be it Heaven or Earth, we find the <hi>four living Creatures, and the twenty four Elders falling down,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 5.5.</note>
                     <hi>having Harps in their hands, &amp;c.</hi> And they who had gotten the victory, <hi>with their Harps of God harping with their Harps, and singing the song of Moses, and of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 14.2. and 15.3.</p>
                  <p>What were the Jews before Christ, Popish and Superstitious! and yet they had all variety of Instruments, and that in the Temple. 'Tis but in vain to tell us that this was a Legal Ceremony, since we read not a word of it in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> Brought it was in by <hi>David,</hi> by <hi>Asaph,</hi> by others.<note place="margin">2 Chro. 29.25, 26.</note> Say they were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; yet what Prophet ever ordained aery thing in Gods service which was unlawfull? The truth is, it was Religious prudence from whence it had its rise; and the reasons which perswaded them to make use of it in Gods service, are as pregnant yet for the continuance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first was to express their joy. <hi>Is any man merry,</hi> saith St. <hi>James, Let him sing Psalms.</hi> In heaven there is nothing but rejoycing,<note place="margin">Jac. 5.13.</note> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but singing, and that the Instrument be not condemned, <hi>it was the Harp too.</hi> Since therefore we have our times of joy as they had,<note place="margin">Rev. 14.2.</note> we may have our song and Harp to express our joy as well as they had.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again this was done to Edifie. Men I conceive are then most edified in Religious worship, when their affections are ordered as becomes pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout men. Now there is not any thing of more power than is a musical harmony, whether by Instrument or voice to bring a composed temper to a discomposed soul: to quicken a heavy spirit, to allay that which is too eager; to mollifie and soften a hard heart, to stay and settle a desperate: In a word, not any so forcible to draw forth tears of devotion, if the heart be such as can yield them. Six noats being curiously varied and carried from the ear to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual faculties of the soul, are able to move and quiet, to raise and moderate all affections:
<q>

                        <l>The hearers soul out by his ears entise.</l>
                     </q> And can there then be any art of more use in Divine Worship, in which the mind ought to be sometimes enclined to heaviness, sometimes raised to a spiritual extasie of joy, sometimes to a holy zeal and indignation, ever carried with such affections as is suitable to the present occasion! Men therefore may speak their pleasure, but let reason be heard, and then the songs of <hi>Zion</hi> will much edifie: If not the understanding, because, say they, these teach not, yet the affections very much, which are the prime wheeles in this work. And he that doubts it, let him remember <hi>Elisha's passion allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Minstrel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 King. 3.15. 1 Sam. 16.16.</note> and <hi>Sauls madnesse calmed by Davids Harp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And yet I do not grant, nor dare not say that Musick doth not teach. For are there not good instructions in Psalms? not many profitable lessons in Anthyms? which yet by the sweetness of melody find the easier entrance, and the longer entertainment. Hear the judgement of the great <hi>Basil.</hi> When the holy Spirit saw that mankind is unto vertue hardly drawn,<note place="margin">Basil <hi>in</hi> Psal.</note> but is propense to what delights, it pleased the wisdom of the same Spirit to borrow from melody that pleasure, which being mingled with the heavenly Mysteries, might by the soft and smooth touch of the ear conveigh as it were by stealth the treasure of good things into the mind. To this purpose were those h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious tunes of Psalmes devised for us, that they who are yet in knowledge but Babes, might when they think they sing, learn. Oh the wise concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that heavenly teacher, which hath by his skill found out a way, that doing those things wherein we delight, we may also learn that wherein we may profit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This the lesson that may be learned from the Ditty: Now from the sweet co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sent and agreement of these voices and Instruments, Christians may learn to agree better. One Viol or Harp out of tune, abates the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phony of the rest; and one jarring Christian mars the musick of the whole Church. Oh how melodious was the praise of God, when it came from men of one heart, and and one mind, as pleasing then, as is to us the Symphony of well tuned Instruments! and ever since these were laid aside, we never were in tune. It were then worth labour to call for them again, and hearken to one of the songs of <hi>Zion</hi> expressed on them; say it were the 133. Psalm, <hi>O quam bonum &amp; quam jucundum,</hi> and by it to learn to come in tune again; thus the fuges and divisions would be sweetned; and as in musick the falling from a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to a cord strangely ravisheth the ear: so all these disagreements in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might perhaps knit and please best after many dislikes. This the God of Unity and Concord grant, who loves not any odious and continued discords in his service.</p>
                  <p>Upon these Reasons the Primitive Christians sang their praises to God. In <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Bithynia, Pliny</hi> tells us, that all which could be laid to their charge was,<note place="margin">Tertul.

               <p>VVHen I read that those who glory in the name of Saints, should yet cast an ill eye upon those words of the Creed, <hi>the communion of Saints;</hi> no little wonder and astonishment (such is I profess my dulness and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance) hath affected me; I cast about to know the cause of this dislike; what might be the crime of this clause? how it had offended? that it must now in the fagg end of the world come under the spunge! Especially since this is so consonant to these Scriptures, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.19, 20. and besides others, this very place I have read unto you; out of all which places Interpreters with one voice have collected <hi>the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then should be the cause this clause should be exploded, I could not conceive, till at last I remembred that <hi>Donatus</hi> was risen again, and with his breath had poisoned the multitude, who out of blind zeal and fancy they bore to particular and separate Congregations, that suppose the name of Saints could not agree to the Catholick Church, neither might any be of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, who were not admitted vvithin the vvalls of their Meeting-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. To believe then a Catholick Church, and in it a Communion of Saints, who vvere not members of their Congregations, is in their judgement to believe a lye.</p>
               <p>See vvhat self-love will do, not only make men high-minded, to think too vvell of themselves, but also to disdain and judge uncharitably of others, even to excommunicate them, and hold them no better than Heathens and Publicans, because they will not forfeit their wits, captivate their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, sit down and break bread with them. Were this their severity to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, what would become of all the Saints departed before they were born! what of greater number of Christians in the <hi>Eeastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Churches? all which died in the bosome of the Catholick Church, and believed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, being utterly unacqainted with the necessity of collected Churches in their sense for the attaining of salvation.</p>
               <p>Assured they were, that Christs body was but one, the parts whereof were <hi>knit together by those bonds</hi> our Apostle mentions in the former verses,<note place="margin">Verse 4, 5, 6.</note> and therefore doubted not to esteem these in the society of Saints who professed <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme</hi> with them; whether sincerely, or fainedly, they left it to God to judge. Yet if among these they found any corrupt, scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous members, by the power of the keys, they cast them out as unfit for their communion.</p>
               <p>The rest in charity they held to be of the body of the Church; And if it may not offend some uncharitable ears, Saints; and I conceive it an error to think otherwise: which mistake doth I know arise out of heat of zeal, but not well grounded as it ought to be upon knowledge; for were that distinction of Saints by calling, and Saints by a true faith and life, well heeded, the mistake would easily vanish, and the offence taken, not given, be removed.</p>
               <p>This distinction is clear in the Scripture, the first part of it in St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  <pb n="534" facs="tcp:200414:273"/> For doth he not send greeting to the <hi>Romans</hi> in this manner <gap reason="foreign">

And all these so called belong to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible body of Christ, because they are admitted by Baptisme, which imports two things. First, a cleansing from all impurity, and secondly, a special ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and consecration to Divine worship; for in Baptisme, the baptized enters into a solemn Covenant with God. He then takes us into his tutelage and service, and we again renouncing all other, take him to be our Lord. We are then to think and speak charitably of all those who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred this Covevant with us, and promiscuously to call them as the Apostle doth, Saints, till by plain and manifest deeds they shall shew themselves to be Apostates or Hypocrites. For as in those things which belong to Faith, we must speak and judge according to the Scripture: so in those things which belong to Charity, it is safe to think and speak according to probability: Which Rule may, I confess, fail us, but w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Formally, truely, really, inwardly, I willingly acknowledge they are not such, and therefore no true members of Christs Mystical Body; which is the other patt of the distinction, to which the Apostle seems to have an eye in the former place to the <hi>Collossians,</hi> for having in general named the Saints, he adds, <hi>and faithful,</hi> as if he would distinguish betwixt the one and the other: Those who seem to be so, and those who really are so. These last are the faithful, truely sanctified by the imputation of Christs Righteousness, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the measure of this life having holiness inherent in them. If then it be now demanded of which of these it is, or whether of both the Creed speaks? I answer, that primarily, and in the first intention it is to be understood of these last, such who are truely and really Saints; and of the other no otherwise than by the judgement of charity they may be presumed to be such, which sober rule of charity for any man out of heat, giddiness, zeal, prejudice, self-conceit to transgress, is the guilt of a Pharisee, and damnable. And thus having first removed what might be cast in my way, I come to open the words which I now read unto you; in which I willingly grant, that the Apostle speaks only of that <hi>communion of Saints,</hi> who truely, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and formally are Members of Christs body, to which he is truely the Head, and to whom they are joyn'd by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>The subject of these words is the Church or society of Saints presented unto us under the notion of a Natural Body, both for the frame, the union, the operation, the growth and increase of the whole and the parts; which Points that we may the more distinctly and clearly apprehend, observe</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first and main Principal of this Body, it is Christ, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from whom it proceeds as from a Fountain, and from whom all the Members receive life, motion, faculties of nutrition, as the parts of a natural body from the head.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this Mystical Body hath two excellent properties.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, fitly joyned together, in that there is Beauty and Order.</item>
                  <item>2. It is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> closely compacted and knit, in this there is unity, consent, and agreement.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Thirdly, we have here taught us the manner how this harmony and beauty, unity and agreement of the whole, and the parts is wrought and continued,
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:200414:273"/> it is done <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by many spiritual ligaments; though the joynts of the body be many, yet they meet and touch, that so they supply to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-part what it wants. In this there is mutual help.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, which help is effectually to be given: So that no part of this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is to be dead or idle, but operative and doing good to his fellow members. Every part of the body, saith the Apostle, must have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> an effectual working.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch work yet is to be done in proportion. According to the gift, and measure of the gift bestowed upon the part, such must the work be, such the supply; it must be done in the measure of every part.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The small cause of this help, working supply; it is not that the single parts seek their own good, but the benefit of the whole body. It is for the increase and edifying of the body.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and lastly, we have here the impulsive cause whence every part of this body is moved to this supply of nourishment. It proceeds, and ought to proceed from love and charity. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the love first that the parts bear to the head, and the charity which they owe to their fellow-members, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens them effectually to supply nourishment for the encrease of the whole. This is the thread I mean to follow for the discovery of the Treasury hidden in the Bowels of this rich Text. And the first piece I meet with is of incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable price, that whose influence gives worth to the whole, without which the body, the ligatures, the supply, the encrease were not worth talking of, no nor to speak properly were at all; For as of Christ is the body, so from him also is the symmetry, agreement, the quick pulse, and motion of the parts, the help which they mutually afford, the gifts which they effectually work to the supportation and encrease of the whole. And therefore following our Apostle, I shall begin with Christ, and consider him in that relation as he stands to the body, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is the Head.</p>

                  <p>The Head is the Notion the Apostle made choice of to represent him unto us in the former verse, and by it understands not a Political head, such as a King is in relation to his people, but a natural head, such as every man car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries above his shoulders, because this resemblance was most apt to shew that clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Position then is sound, and I shall I lay it in the foundation, <hi>that Christ and the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, the whole Body; for Hypocrites and wicked men since they live not in Christ, and increase not in Christ, are truly no parts of this Body. The Elect, the Faithful, the Regenerate only are truly united to him. And this union is neither by imagination, as the mind is united to the object upon which man sets his thought: Nor yet by affection, as one friends heart is united to another by love: Or by composition of substances, as it falls out in mixt bodies: But it is a true and real union, such as we see betwixt the Head and the parts; for by it all the faithful and Christ become <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, one Body: So that first, as from the Head and all the Members there results one man; so from the Person of Christ and all the Elect united and conjoyned to him, there is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>one mystical Body,</hi> which partakes of the same Name,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12.</note> both together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called Christ: And then again, as the body of man, if one part only be wanting, is a maimed and imperfect body; so Christ is pleased to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self maimed and imperfect, if any one of his Elect should be wanting,

                  <p>And that I may yet give some you some further light about this Mystery; in it are to be considered
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>The things united.</hi>
                        </item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The things united is not the soul of Christ with our soul, nor the flesh of Christ with our flesh alone, but the whole person of every faithful man is verily conjoyned with the whole Person of our Saviour God and Man, yet in a Spiritual manner; which what it is, I shall shew you when I come to speak of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>Commissurae</hi> or <hi>ligamenta,</hi> the couplings, or joynts. He saveth both parts, body and soul, and thetefore must be united to both parts, body and soul; for Christ saves not any part that is not his.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for the Root of this union, it hath the Original in the flesh; a faithful man being first united to the Humane nature of Christ by faith, and afterward by the intervenience of the Humanity to the Word, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. We can apprehend, elect, and choose, but as we know; for the will is never mov'd to desire an unknown good. But by the Humanity we come to the knowledge of Christ as he is a Mediatour, and therefore in the order and nature of Faith, his flesh is the first thing we reflect on, to which in our thoughts and desires we joyn. Thus God first proposed him, <hi>The seed of the woman.</hi> Thus the Church desired him, <hi>O that thou wert my Brother!</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.15. Cant. 8 1. Isa. 7.14. Chap. 9.6. Chap. 11.1. Joh. 1.14.</note> Thus the Prophets made mention of him, he was to be <hi>Imman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rth from the Virgins womb, yet when we apprehend him a Redeemer, a Mediatour, we first reflect upon his Manhood, because without effusion of blood he could not Redeem, he could not Mediate.</p>
                  <p>What should I say, that the Patriarchs before he was Incarnate, were in this sense united unto him, and Members under this head? Not as if they were joyn'd to his Humanity as actually existent, but joyned to it as really existent to their Faith. <hi>He was the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.19, 20. Rev. 5.12.</note> in Gods decree for his passion, in his own voluntary offer; and such the Fathers apprehended him, <hi>and Abraham rejoyced to see that day;</hi> as much,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.56.</note> that he was to be <hi>Incarnandus,</hi> as we now that he is <hi>Incarnatus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause without this Incarnation they knew he could not break the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head.</p>
                  <p>If then the Question be moved, according to what Nature Christ is the Head unto his Body? The answer must be, according to both. For the Church must have such a Head, which should be able to infuse a spiritual life into the body, which power is proper to the Deity. And again, the Church must have such a Head that must have a conformity of Nature with the parts, which is proper to the Humanity. So that in the Person of Christ, God and Man, both these conditions are found conjoyn'd. And form the Deity, the life of grace is infused, as from the first Agent; but from the Humanity, the same life and grace comes, as from the Organ and Instrument joyn'd to the first Cause. As therefore it doth no way derogate from the honour of the head, the head even of this natural body, that it imparts life, sense, and
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:200414:274"/> motion to the other parts, not immediately, but by other nerves and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: So is it not any way derogatory to the dignity of this mystical Head, that by his Humanity, as by a pipe or channel, he conveys grace and life to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member of his Body. Primarily then, and principally the influence comes from that Deity that dwelt in our nature; but secondarily and instrumentally by that flesh of ours, which he was pleased to take upon him.</p>
                  <p>I will say it over again. The Deity is the fountain from whence springs this our spiritual life and being: The Humanity the Organ that conveys it to us. By man it was that sin entred; and by man came righteousnesse; By man came death, by man came life; By man entred condemnation, by man remission. Hence Saint <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>Qui edit carnem,</hi> i. e. <hi>qui credit carnem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 6.53, 54.</note>

The flesh of the Son of God is for our sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and must first by faith be digested, before he can be bread of life. What grace soever comes to us, comes through the Son of <hi>Mary.</hi>

                  <p>And in the Sacraments, as in two Christal glasses this ttuth is very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: In both which there be two parts; the visible signe, and invisible grace; the elements from the earth, but the effect from heaven. A faithful soul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth preparedly, and takes a share of both. But in what order? is it not in the same order as they are proposed by Christ? First, the visible, put case the water, bread, and wine: Then remission of sin, and whole Christ. As in this divine dispensation the material part is received first, and after under that, and by that the spiritual: So also in this Union you must first reflect upon Christ as a perfect man, and in that Nature be conjoyned to him, before you can be of his Body, and have any benefit of the divine nature. Blood you must know he must have, before he can be a Redeemer. Flesh, in which he may be united, before he can be the Head to this Body.</p>
                  <p>These two points being cleared, because the Apostle here teacheth, that from this Head it is, that the whole Church becomes one body; in the next place let us examine in what sense Christ is said to be the head to this Body; and since this is a Metaphor transfer'd from a Natural Head to this mystical, the meaning will be very obscure, till we understand in what this Analogy betwixt the Head and Christ, the Body and the Church doth consist. This being known, will give light to what follows.</p>
                  <p>This Similitude drawn from a physical Body, doth admirably agree to Christ, both in respect of that prerogative which the Head hath over the members, and also the convenience and coherence which the Head hath with the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The prerogatives of the Head are three. 1. To be above. 2. to govern. 3. To have an influence upon every part of the Body. All which belong to Christ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Head must be in the most eminent place,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.21.</note> and most eminent in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Thus is Christ placed above all principalities and powers, and in perfections far above all men and Angels. For when in these we finde a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Graces, so that one wants that gift in which another abounds, in Christ all the gifts of Grace do concurre; Adde to this, that all the Members of this Body, have these gifts with a limitation, and in a remiss degree, but in Christ all these graces were extensively, and intensively, both for the kinds of Grace, and the highest degree that could be imagined. For thus it is written, and thus we read; <hi>In him are all the treasures of wisdome and knowledge:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2.3. Joh. 3.34.</note>
                     <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit being not given unto him by measure:</hi> In which respect he may be well said to have the Dignity and preheminence of the Head, in which is the seat of the soul and minde adorned with those eminent faculties of Understanding, Will, Memory, Prudence and Wisdome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next preheminence of the Head is, to have Lordship and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:200414:275"/> over the Members. The Head is to direct and govern, the parts to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and governed: So Christ is to be Lord over his Body, and the Body to be obedient to him, as the wife to the husband; if the Apostle may be heard to speak, thus it must be, for thus he prescribes, <hi>Wives, be subject to your own husbands,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.22.</note>
                     <hi>as the Church is subject to Christ.</hi> It were preposterous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous for the feet to attempt to rule, or the hand to command.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The last prerogative of the Head, is, that from it as a common fountaine, proceeds life, motion and being, which it imparts and communicates to every part; which is hence most evident; for upon the separation of the Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> from the Body, it becomes senselesse, nor lives, nor moves. Such a Head is Christ, such a Fountaine to this his Body; in him is the Well of life, and from him we receive Grace after Grace.<note place="margin">Psal. 36.9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Life he hath in himself, and life he imparts to us, whence saith our Apostle, now <hi>I live,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note>
                     <hi>yet not I, but Christ lives in me;</hi> Christ now is the supposite; by him it is that we are quickened, and expresse all the effects of a living man. Motion also we have from him, when our motions are conformable to his mind; which conformity lies in two chief points. First, in a conformity to his death, that as he died for sin, so every part of his body be mortified, and dead to sin.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.3, 4.</note> Then in a conformity to his Resurrection, that as he rose from the grave, so they rise to newnesse of life. As for their being also, that the members have from this Head; there is a being of Nature, and a being of Grace; the first way a creature of God, a man may be without any relation at all to Christ; but in Grace a man hath no being at all, if Christ be absent. The presence of this Head, and the continuance of this Head with us, is that which makes us what we are, true Christians. Whence <hi>Zanchy</hi> aptly observes,<note place="margin">Zanch. in loc.</note> that the Apostle saith not <hi>A quo totum corpus,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>ex quo.</hi> For of him as from the first cause are all creatures, that is a <hi>quo:</hi> But from him the Church is, and hath its being, as the Members in a Natural Body from the Head, which live, move, and increase from it. And this saith he is, <hi>Ex quo;</hi> From which if separated, they are destitute of life, sense, motion, being stupid and dead.</p>
                  <p>You have seen how apt this Metaphor is in respect of the three prerogatives the Head hath over the Members; I shall now acquaint you that it is altogether as fit in respect of that convenience and coherence, which the Head hath with the Members; and that also lies in three respects. 1. In conformity. 2. In order to the end. And 3. In the harmony of the Head and Members.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Head must have conformity with the Members. It is not enough that it be corporeal, for so a painter may clap, a Foxes, Asses, or Lions head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mans shoulders, but it must be of the same species, of the same nature. Now in this respect, there was and is a very great agreement betwixt this Head, and the parts of his body; <hi>for he was in all things like us, sin only excepted. Bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh; for he took not on him the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4.15.</note>
                     <hi>but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Forasmuch as the children were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of flesh and blood,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 2.14.15.</note>
                     <hi>he also was a partaker of the same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next agreement of Head and Members is that they both aime at the same end, which is the conservation of the whole, and the happiness of the person. The faculties of the soul take up their residence in the Head, and their whole scope and labour is, that the little Common-wealth of man receive no detriment, but be furthered in his way of felicity. And this is the labour of this our Head; he sustains, quickens, and wisely moderates all things: He is touched with our evils, hears us, speaks for us, and being our Advocate pleads for us. 'Tis the care of this Head to bring every Member of his own body to glory and Beatitude.<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.23. Joh. 17.12.</note>
                     <hi>He is the Saviour of his body,</hi> and he safely preserves the meanest part, <hi>so that not one of them shall perish,</hi> but participate an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and happy life together with their Head.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="539" facs="tcp:200414:275"/>3. The members and head of a natural body agree in this, that their extreams are coupled with a common term, and that they all receive their activity, and are informed by the same soul. So also this Mystical Head, and all the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>dy are continued and united one to the other, receiving their spiritual life and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from the same Principle. The power and unspeakable force of his Spirit, notwithstanding the distance of place, doth most truly and effectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, fitly joyned together and compacted.</p>

                  <p>You see how at unawares I am fallen upon the first Attribute of this Body, which is that this body be fitly joyn'd; For as the Body of man must not be composed of monstrous, dissonant and uneven parts, but of such pieces which are congruous to the whole: So also must this Mystical Body of Christ be knit together by fit proportions, that one part aptly answers to the other, and all agree very well to the Head. And this condition will serve to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Errors of three sorts of men, the Hypocrite and prophane person, the Heterodox Christian, and the factious Pragmatick.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Hypocrite is no fit member, nor yet the prophane. Not the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, because he hath only the paint and colour of a part, and not the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal spirit by which the part lives and moves. Not the profane, for he is but an excrement and a noxious humour, fitter to be purged out, than joyn'd to the Body. Both these are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and have no harmony at all with the Head, which is perfect, pure, and holy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Heterodox Christian, is either a swollen part, or withered; swollen with pride and excess of Traditions, and Doctrines of men. Or so shrunk and hidebound, that he cannot admit, if only for decency and Order, a prudent Ceremony. And while the one is ambitious to exceed, the other so peevish to fall short, one for too much, the other for too little, the harmony of the parts is marred, and the body rendred deformed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But the Poly-pragmon is the man that dislocates every part, and therefore is the greatest enemy to the comely Order of this Body; of him therefore I shall speak a litle more fully.</p>
                  <p>In a Natural body, that Order must be observ'd that every part be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his proper place, and in that place perform its work. The Organs of sense are set in the Head, the power of digestion in the stomack, of sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the liver; the hands keep their site, and the feet their position. And thus it must be in this Mystical body, every member must keep its place and order, and do its office, and not usurp upon his fellow member; otherwise the benefit and beauty of the whole will be disturb'd.</p>
                  <p>Order then can never be, where there is not <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>b &amp; supra.</hi> That there be in the Church some of a Superiour, others of an inferiour rank; some as eyes, other as hands; some as ears, others as tongues, is necessary; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the society of Saints could never resemble a body fitly put together. But if you shall now ask, why it pleased Christ the Head to honour one member, and humble another; to make him an eye, or tongue, and that man an ear, a hand, or foot; no reason can be given, but his wisdom,<note place="margin">1 Cor 12.11. Rom. 9.21.</note>
                     <hi>who distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to every one as he will: The Potter hath power over the clay;</hi> more cannot be said, and that must content. For the Order we can give you a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because he is the God of Order and not confusion: Which that it may be kept, he ordains some to be Princes, some subjects; some Lords, some
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:200414:276"/> servants; some to be Apostles, some Evangelists; some to be Teachers, others to be taught; some Shepherds, some to be sheep; as he diversly distributes his Talents, so he designs divers men to several places and Functions; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the measure and variety of their gifts, their Offices are set out. This is the beauty, this the apt and admirable order of this Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body.</p>
                  <p>The more too blame they then, whose labour it is to dislocate the parts; endeavour they do to put the ears into the place of the eyes, and the eyes into the place of the feet, while they make the lowest of the people Priests, and the Priests the lowest of the People. Is not this to disturb the Order which God hath set? Is not this to bring a deformity on the whole body? <hi>Cyclops</hi> was held for a Monster, because he had but one eye, and yet it was in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; what a strange creature should that man be, who should have his eyes in his heels?

                  <p>'Tis a wise observation of a wise man, that the Spirit of God hath bestowed upon every man some peculiar ability to one Art, Trade, Profession or other, of which if men would take notice, and bend themselves that way especially, there would be a better proficiency in all Sciences and Professions than there is.

Let them then who sow and ripen Divisions in the Church, lay to heart, by what spirit they are guided. Were it by the Spirit of God, there would be nothing but peace, nothing but love; for his property is to collect and gather, nor to divide and scatter.

                  <p>Faith is taken for the grace by which we believe, or that object which we believe; and the old rule was that This could not be enlarged, this could not be diminished: It is overmuch pride then in <hi>Rome</hi> to double these Articles; 'tis presumption in any Novelist to impare them, and make them fewer: 'tis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness and peevishness in factious spirits to separate for accessories.</p>

                  <p>This God is the Father of Christ by nature, of Christians by adoption, of all men and all things by creation, above all, and through all, and in you all.

               <p>THat which the Apostle aims at here, is the growth and perfection of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; his intention is, that no part stand at a stay, but increase together with the whole; without which growth, it will be no fitter member for this, then the arm or leg of a child would be for the body of a man. The Organical Body in the course of nature admits not of any dry and sinew-shrunk part, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Christ approve that in his Body there be any one limb which thrives not, be dwarf'd and disproportionable. Which to prevent, look what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:200414:278"/> the Natural Head affords to all parts of the body, the same also this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Head Christ graciously bestows upon his.</p>
               <p>As then in the Natural and Organical Body of man before it hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd its just stature,<note place="margin">Beza.</note> the vital faculty flowing from the Head doth insinuate it self into every part; and by distribution of fit nourishment supplies to every joint what is necessary and fit for it, that thereby it may grow to such a quantity, proportion, and vigour, as is requisite for the Body: So also is it in this case; Christ the Head of the Church, which is his Mystical Body, bestows upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part such power and vertue, so much nourishment and grace as is needful for the life, vegetation, and increase of every limb, that it may arrive at its full measure, and the whole be perfected.</p>
               <p>To that end this Body is joyned together no otherwise than our Natural is, that hath <hi>varias juncturas &amp; commissuras,</hi> many and divers ligaments; it hath tendons, sinews, nerves, arteries, muscles, veins, and so hath this too, divers bonds to tye it together, and various vessels to convey the vital spirit and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, which yet all depend upon the Head, and yet they touch and move one another.

                  <p n="2">2. But among the first kind of Graces, the cheif is Faith: this is the gift of God, and it is given for an especial help also. For by this the Grace of the Gospel is derived to us. The obedience of Christ, active and passive, is nothing to us, till we believe it; and the pardon of sin, which he hath promised, empty words till apprehended by Faith. <hi>For faith is the confidence of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> with which the Fathers being animated, did and suffered all those things the Apostle speaks of. By this nerve then also any part of this body being moved makes its increase. And any augmentation whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is made without it, is but a tumour, nothing profitable to this body; Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table did I say? nay altogether unprofitable; a specious sin, though to us it seems a good work,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.5.</note> since it proceeds not from an <hi>heart purg'd by Faith.</hi>

                     </gap>, I must not omit the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For these are Corroboratives and Cordials; they give strength, and they refresh, strengthen against sin, and quench the raging flames of a disquiet soul. For in the blood of Christ conveighed by these pipes, there is an Artery by which the vital spirit is derived also, which will quicken, revive, and cheer up any fainting and dying soul. These ligaments then as those before, are for supply and increase of the Body. These are all Church-bonds; and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny holy Nerves, all which have their power and operation from the first bond; <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Spirit, for he is to give the first touch and stroke to these, and then the pulse will convey the supply even and right.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And might it not seem a little out of the way, my reason tempts me to put you in mind of a succout and help even from Natural bonds to this very work. That men are of the same flesh, Kins-men and of the same blood, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and of the same Countrey, dwellers in the same house, Husband and Wife, Parents and Children, Masters and Servants, may be notable Motives as for Unity, so also for aid to this end. For Christ hath not taken off from our necks these bonds of love, but rather laid them on in a stricter manner, and blessed them. The bond of Nature, Relation, and Affinity calls upon us now for this duty, not only because is is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he voice of reason and policy, but because it is the voice of Christ, who commands and expect it from us; or he came not to dissolve the Law, but to fulfil it.

                  <p>There be three ends of the Nerves, Sinews, Tendons in the Natural Body. 1. That all the parts be by them join'd together, and to the Head. 2. That by these the vital spirits, blood, and nourishment be received from the head. 3. That by these what is received, be convey'd and imparted to the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which the Apostle especially intends in this place, and therefore he stiles them <hi>commissurae subministrationis,</hi> joynts of help and supply.<note place="margin">Juucture vulg.</note>

Just as do the members of the Natural Body, in which every one confers its several gift, office, work, to the general benefit of the whole. Under the Law, some brought gold, some silk, others fine linnen, and some goats hair,<note place="margin">Exod. 35.20, 21, 22.</note> but all to the furniture of the Tabernacle: so we are to lay together all graces, all places, all works that we have, and to imploy them to the advancement of the common faith, and to the setting forward the common salvation.</p>

                  <p>An evil sickness there is under the Sun, that provokes men to break their Techers, and to meddle with other mens Vocations. Believe it, every work is not for every hand; if so, what needed so accurate a distribution, a fit measure to every part? And where this order is transgressed, it is as great an absurdity, as if the parts of the body should invade each others Functions and Offices. In the body of man there is the spirits, blood, choler, and

And the like happens in Body of Christ the Church; the gifts bestowed in measure upon every part being kept within their vessels, and so implyed, do well; but if once they pass their bounds, some unkind heats, or swelling Apostumes, or Jaundise, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and dangerous diseases overrun the body of the Church, by which the end for which they were given, and for which they were thus wisely and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposed and measured out, is wholly evacuated, which the Apostle tells us here was for an encrease of the body, that it may</p>

I presume you have read of the golden Candlesticks, wherein through seven pipes of gold, the oyl was continually carried from the two Olives.

                  <p>I with greif acknowledge how subject this holy building is to winds, to floods, to storms; for the violent gusts of temptations descend and beat upon it: the Christian, who is this House, being exposed to the weather.

                  <p>True it is, that in all parts there must be a just increase, otherwise there can be no just proportion; Legs, thighs, feet, armes, hands, heart, &amp;c. must all grow up together: which rule must be observed in the spiritual increase; in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faculty and part of the man of God there must be an even spreading of the supply from the head; in the mind there must be an increase of knowledge, in the heart of love and charity; in the affections, of fear, reverence, humility; in the tongue, of truth; in the hands, of good works; in the feet, of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse to walk in the wayes of God.</p>

I know not what strange influence this one syllable <hi>Love</hi> hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the touches, all the supply that the parts of this body afford each other, so that if they be not done in love, they are nothing worth, This our Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. dicourses of the spiritual gifts, acquaints us that they are many, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, shews that they are given for decency, for service, for succour of the same Body. He names also many functions, Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, Workers of miracles, gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, but in the close he tells them, he would yet shew them a more exellent way, and what was this way, that was most exellent? It was the way of love and charity, without which the gifts how exellent soever, were nothing worth. Should a man be indued with all knowledge, could he speake all tongues, and all truths,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> yet were they not seasoned with charity, in Gods ear the man were but as a soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding brass, and as a tinkling cymbal; this, this one is the bond of perfection,<note place="margin">Col. 3.14.</note> it conjoins and links together all the vertues, and puts the life of Christianity into their Acts; It unites all the members of this body together, and makes every part, willingly, chearfully, readily to communicate their mutual endeavours for the encrease and conservation of the whole. As then the perfection of the natural Body ariseth from the union and connexion of the parts, so that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is presently imperfect, and defective, if joint be pulld and severed from joint; So also the Body of the Church is perfect and entire while all the members are united and coupled together with the bond of charity; but upon the breach of that one link, mercy, and humility, and meekness, and patience take the wing and fly away, upon which there enters cruelty, and pride, and frowardness and impatience into this Body, which makes it weak and imperfect.</p>
                  <p>It were to draw a line after <hi>Apelles,</hi> to enter upon an Encomium of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, since our Apostle hath set it forth to us in fifteen lively colours; I meane those Attributes, partly negative, partly affirmative; what it doth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> what it doth not, that this body may not be distracted, but be kept together. It doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie the felicity or preheminence of another part. It is not peevish, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and rash in censuring its fellow-members.

It behaves it self not unseemly either through pride or immodesty; 'tis not so immodest as to scandal any, nor so proud as to domineere over the meanest part of the body. It seeks not her own, it doth nothing out of self-love or filthy lucre, but considers how it may supply the want of another part. It is not easily provoked, not to wrath, not to revenge; or if it be, 'tis against some corrupt humour in the member, not the member. It thinks no evil; for it is not suspitious, ready to censure that to the worst, which may admit of a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did interpretation. It rejoyceth not in iniquity, is not glad to do a mischief to its fellow members. Hitherto you have seene what love and charity will not do; for by all these Saturnine influences the supply, the increase, the building up this body will be hindered, and therefore Charity will be sure to be free from them.</p>
                  <p>And now you shall see what it will do for the increase of the body. First, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="554" facs="tcp:200414:283"/> or a vital part, which yet if it break forth, the Sun shall not set upon its wrath. For it is kinde not only in bearing an injury, but in the readinesse to forgive and forget it. And it rejoyceth in or with the truth; glad it is at heart, when truth and justice flourish, and take place: as it is apt to weep with the part that weeps, so it will rejoyce with any member, that hath cause to rejoyce. <hi>I bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things;</hi> Bears all things that may be born; Bears prosperity without pride, adversity without discontent and murmur. <hi>It beleeves all things,</hi> believes that parts of the body are such as they seeme to be; such in words, such in deeds, till it finde a manifest evidence to the contrary. But if it happen, which too often falls out, that some part be <hi>laxatum,</hi> broken or dis-joynted, <hi>it will hope all things,</hi> it will hope that it may be restored, strengthned, and joynted again. And to that end lastly, <hi>it endures all things,</hi> any injury, any affront with a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and composed minde, out of that infinite desire and affection it bears to peace.</p>
                  <p>Oh then that the God of love, and Spirit of unity would but gift the parts of this body with rhis admirable vertue! for then I would not doubt of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, I would hope better of the edifying of it, which now by discord I finde much to be impair'd, through debate and dissention weakned, distracted, I had almost said ruin'd.</p>

Nothing ought to be more dear to us in the world, than the Church of Christ; And every one of us, were we true members of it, to our utmost endeavour we should defend it. help to encrease it, build it, and preserve the unity of it when it is built. The Nerves by which it is united and conserv'd, are not Rites and Ceremonies, but true Faith, and brotherly love. How then do I what I can, to preserve this Communion of Saints, when with discord, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and peevishnesse, as with a sword I divide and dissolve the bond with which it is united!</p>
                  <p>Yea, but perhaps there be who will pretend, Is there not a cause? are we not bound to speak the Truth? No love of peace must be so great, that we contend not earnestly for the Truth once delivered to the Saints;<note place="margin">Jude 3.</note> for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and peace must kisse each other,</p>
                  <p>To contend for the Truth, is a noble quality; But then men must be sure it is the Truth they contend for, and then too, such a Truth which is worth conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which this Body may be encreased, this building promoted, not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, not cooled in devotion, of which nature the most part of those points are, which as supposed truths are on all hands contended for by the dissenting party from the established Doctrine of the Church at this day. Yet suppose they were Truths, which they are not: our Apostles direction must not be forgotten,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.15</note> delivered in the former verse, <hi>Speak the truth in love.</hi> Truth then must be followed and administred with its true corrective, love. Now love teacheth us, that though we speak the Truth, yet to be patient and courteous, patiently to hear what is objected, and mildly to reply. 'Tls reported of the Philosophers, who were alwayes quarrelling about their principles, that they had a sword, but wanted a buckler; but a buckler becomes a Christian better than a sword. For we must not beat every dogge that barks at us in the way, <hi>but with patience run the race that is set before us.</hi> Wise <hi>Solomon</hi> hath left written,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.1. Prov. 15.1. Acts 23.5.</note> that <hi>a soft answer pacifieth strife;</hi> such a one we find dropping from Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> lips; <hi>Brethren, I knew not that he was the high Priest;</hi> and so satisfied a mistake.</p>
                  <p>Adde to this, that Love, as I but now said, <hi>envies not, swels not, deals not f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="555" facs="tcp:200414:283"/> with those truths it knows, nor out of a froward humour thwarts and crosses any truth whatsoever, being ready without grief and repining, to yeild where it sees an apparent evidence. A vertue it is compounded of, truth and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; Truth moves it to believe that only which is certaine; ingenuity construes all to the best sense, even that which is doubtful; whereas suspicion and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie is transported with heat, and forgetting the bounds of modesty, is misled with false, probable, vulgar and uncertain reports.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you now, let it be considered, whether the great pretenders and zealots of truth, stand not in great need of this corrective. Where is their Love? What is become of their Charity? are not we members of their body? Are we not all under one Head? Are we not united with the same Nerves? Do we not all hope to meet in heaven? Have we not all one Christ? Serve we not all one Father? How is it then that they so unkindly separate from their fellow-members, or rather separate the members from them? Is this to build? is this to edifie? is this to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fford supply for the encrease of the Body? If envy, and anger, and peevishnesse, and froward usage can contribute to this spiritual work, then these are excellent architects, rare helps. For envious they are at any part above them, angry with every sound limb, peevish and froward to all the sinews and arteries; they do not only think, but study an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>urie: So far from patience and courtesie, that as a nest of angry Hornets and Wasps, they sting all that come in their way. To produce their scornful, bitter, and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable invectives, were to rake a Dunghil, in which you shall finde the poyson of Aspes; few, I had almost said, not one feather of the Dove.</p>
                  <p>My hearty desire is, that they would first learn <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to speak truth: of which since I despair, yet that they would give over this gall of bitternesse, and say what they fancie for Truth in Love and meeknesse. This might make some impression upon us to think, that the work proceeded from that spirit to which they so much pretend, the Loving Spirit; Whereas when we meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bitternesse, scofs, scandals, violence, invectives and libels in their Pulpits, in their Pamphlets, we are assured that the suggestion is from another Author. Truth needs no Cyniques, nor her dictates such Patrons who sleep their pens in Vine-acre.</p>
                  <p>O that our Dissenting Brethren would think they were men, and therefore not impossible for them to erre. O that they would lay to heart that they are Christian men, and therefore bound <hi>to speak the truth in love:</hi> Were there an impartial sifting of these debates and differences, found it would be,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.15.</note> that it is not strength of reason, but vehemency of affection, self-love, self-ends, or some discontent, which first bred, and doth yet feed these debates amongst us. Far more comfort it were for us (so small is the joy we take in tugging at one end of this Saw) to labour under the same yoke, as men who look for the same eternal reward of our labours; and being joyned in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissoluble bond of love and amity, to live as if our persons being many, our souls were but one: It is a Corrosive unto us to live in this dismembred condition, and to spend our few and wretched dayes in a tedious prosecution of endlesse contentions; the end whereof, if they have not some speedy end, will be heavie on both sides. I am no Prophet, nor son of a Prophet, but I have liv'd to see the troubles of sixteen yeats, out of which, he, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conclude the sad consequences that follow upon contentions in Religion, and separation from confessed and ancient Truths, must needs be a man of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shallow understanding.</p>
                  <p>By this strife the lives of men are become deboysed, the devotion of many is cooled. Grown we are to be a scorn and a proverb of reproach to the men of <hi>Gath,</hi> and the inhabitants of <hi>Askelon,</hi> they stand by,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 1.20.</note> behold our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, clap their hands, and inflame them, little doubting thereby to make their
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:200414:284"/> own advantage, as indeed they do daily: that I say not, how by these Schismes, with the wiser and better sort of our own, our credit is quite lost. God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty allay these stormes, and set a period to these turbulent and swelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimosities, that we may all at last speak the Truth, and speak the Truth in love: That we all lay to heart, that we are all but one body, fitly joyned and joynted under one head; that we are all moved by one and the same Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are bound to supply to every part; in that measure that the Spirit hath sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to us help and nourishment. By this means there will be an increase in the Communion of Saints, and every particular will grow to be a perfect man in Christ Jesus. A perfection he will attain to, such as the state of passengers and wayfaring men doth admit in this life, which will be made exact, absolute, and down-right, when he shall be joyn'd to this Head in heaven; That is the Mansion of the Church triumphant, this the place prepared for the Church militant; both are but parts of one Society; that perfect, this in the way to perfection; that crowned already, this to be crowned. In hope of which, let us unite, and love, and live together; so the God of peace will blesse us, the Prince of peace will protect us, the Spirit of love and unity will take a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to dwell with us, and we shall dwell with this Trinity in Unity, and with all those Saints with whom we have continued in unity, for ever and ever: Which God grant for Christ Jesus sake, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>IN this Epistle of Saint <hi>John</hi> all Expositors finde a great difficulty; and that which encreaseth it, is, because they have not well observed the stile a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d forme in which it is written. For the Syntax of this Epistle is not as some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther books, where the whole is by a perpetual connexion linked and filed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, containing short, brief and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious sentences, out of which the whole web, as of divers strings and threads is made up, consisting of certaine precepts of Doctrine and Rules of life, <hi>that the man of God may</hi> thereby <hi>be made perfect.</hi> Here then we shall meet with many golden Aphorismes to informe our judgement, and direct our manners: Theological conclusions to cure our ignorance, and Moral precepts to mend our Ethicks; our Apostle being like the learned Masters of Physick in the one,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:200414:284"/> and the Teachers of Morality in the other. Both these have their Aphorisms to cure diseases and vices: He his, to remove mistakes and Heresies; and to shame licentious Christians.</p>
               <p>In his time there were who boasted very much of their fellowship they had with the Saints, of their Society with God the Father, and his Sonne Jesus Christ. That there was such a Society, he grants; but then presseth them with divers other consequences, as undeniable Notes and Characters, by which it might be known whether they were of this Society; for example,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They must not walk in darknesse, <hi>for God is light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 5.6, 7.</note>
                  <hi>and in him there is no darknesse at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They must not say, they have no sinne; and desire pardon,<note place="margin">Verse 8.10, 9.</note> for else they deceive themselves, and are lyars.</p>
               <p>For there are two especial works of a good Christian; the study of a pure and holy life, that he may be like God; and a sense and confession of his sinne, that the blood of Jesus Christ may cleanse him. To these two endeavours there be two very great impediments; a vitious course of life, and an over-weening presumption of his own perfection and goodnesse. Now in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> dayes, some there were that thrust themselves into the society of both kinds. First, there were inordinate walkers, that lived in darknesse and the shadow of death, who yet no nay, would be esteemed of this Communion;<note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> to these Saint <hi>John</hi> gives the flat lye. <hi>If we,</hi> even we the Apostles, <hi>say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darknesse, we lye, and do not the truth.</hi> Then there were dissemblers and hypocrites, a sort of people pure in their own eyes, who took upon them not to be like other men; holy creatures they would needs be, and not as other Publicans; other men they knew to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but they forsooth were free. Now Saint <hi>John</hi> tells such Saints, that they gave God the lye. <hi>If we say that we have no sinne, we make God a lyar,</hi> and his Word, that is, his Doctrine, <hi>hath no place in us.</hi> A great error then and mistake there is on both hands. The safe way lies in the middest, <hi>viz.</hi> To avoid sin as darknesse, and to confesse our sins to God, as becomes misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wretehes. The one will keep us from profanesse, the other from spiritual pride.</p>

                     <hi>Darkness</hi> is opposed to <hi>light;</hi> and as contraries, they serve well to illustrate one another; all our light in this World hath its Defects and Eclipses; but in this <hi>light</hi> there is no Defect, no Eclipse at all.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But with us it is quite otherwise; naturally there is gross <hi>darkness</hi> in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding by ignorance and errour; a Night of hatred and malice of the true

And this inward darkness exposeth us to those <hi>ex teriores tenebras,</hi> that outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, where there is no manner of light at all, none to be seen, none to be felt.</p>
                  <p>It is then the purpose of Saint <hi>John</hi> in this place, not so much to express unto us, what God is in himself, as what he is to us, and in us. That as in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self he is a pure light, so also in us he is the fountain of all light, that is, of all truth, all goodness, all justice which is in us; he expels the darkness of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the mind, and purgeth the will from the love of sin. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth the understanding, and teacheth us what is to be done, and effectually and powerfully excites the will to choose and embrace it: As in him, so also in that light he holds forth, there is no darkness at all, no ground for error, no countenance for wickedness; no nor in us neither, if we have any fellow-ship with him; no such palpable darkness as will destroy the light of Truth, nor such malicious wickedness as can no way consist with his holiness.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Is God light? Is he the father of lights?</hi> is he such a Father in which <hi>there is no shadow of darkness?</hi> then it behoves us to take heed of all dark works because they are opposite to him, the Mother of them being our own concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, and the father the prince of darkness. Many are the names in Scripture given to sin, by which we may be warned to abhor it.<note place="margin">Hos. 6.4. Jer. 5.25. Zach. 6.7. Lev. 13.</note> T'is a <hi>cloud</hi> that hinders our prayer: T'is a <hi>wall</hi> that makes a partition betwixt God and man: T'is a <hi>weight of lead,</hi> that hanging at our hearts, puls them downward: T'is a <hi>leprosie,</hi> a soul disease, that pollutes the flesh, the house, the man. But there is not any, that expresseth the nature of it so fully as this of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For as in darkness all things lie confus'd and heap'd up together, as in the <hi>chaos;</hi> when light was created, every thing was put in his his right place: so it is in sin; there is nothing but confusion, but disorder; It is the light of truth and equity, that must set all right. Again, cold is the companion of darkness, as heat of light. The frosts fall in the night, at the approach of the light they give and thaw; so in a dark soul there be but cold, heavy, frosty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; the more of God, the more light; and the more light, the more warmth of love. Or lastly sin bears this name of darkness, because it is at rest in a dark soul; begotten there by the father of darkness, and leads to the place of eternal darkness. Take it in what sense you will, enough there is in it to make you hate it, if you love God; for he is a God of pure eyes, and cannot behold the foulness and pollution of wickedness; he is the God of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and hates confusion. His light warms the heart, and therefore will not dwell with frosty affections. Nothing so opposite to him as deeds of darkness, which arise from the father of darkness, and therefore he will not cohabit with him in a black soul.</p>
                  <p>Go to now then you workers of iniquity, plead your priviledge, boast of your fellowship with the Father, with Jesus Christ, and with his Saints, so that you know all this while, you do but deceive your own souls. For although such specious and outside Professors, do out-mouth as I may so say, true believers in bragging of familiarity with God, and his Son; yet the truth is, so long as they walk in darkness, it is impossible they should be children of the light: For in God is no darkness, nor so much as a shadow of it.<note place="margin">Jac. 1.17.</note> But of this more hereafter.</p>

               <p>IT hath alwayes been the work of Satan to dim the light of true Religion; for he being darkness himself, labours to have all others dark and black like him.</p>
               <p>Hence it was, that Light no sooner appeared in the world, but his labour was to extinguish it.

               <p>All this while Satan roared as a Lion, but finding that violence was not the way to work his ends; he chang'd his course, and takes that of the Serpent; what by cruelty he could not suppress, he studies by subtilty to stain. His po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy now was to infuse an opinion into mens heads, that a man may live as he please, and yet be Christian good enough. This damnable conception was hatched betime; for in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> time there were the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi>

So in the Church, there be <hi>filii regis,</hi> true children of the King of heaven, born to be heirs of an eternal inheritance. And <hi>filii regni</hi> who make a shew of obedience, but are indeed dissemblers, whose portion is the Kingdom of darkness. It were happy for these men, could they learn in time to

               <p n="1">1. The first Note of those who are in the kingdom, is, thar <hi>They say they have fellowship with God: that they are of the family, of the house, of the Society of Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The next note is, <hi>that in manners and conversation they are far from it; They walk in darkness.</hi> Their words and works are so far asunder, <hi>that they lye, and do not the truth.</hi> Those are the two Notes belonging to those who are the Sons of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>One Note there is, which belongs to those who are true Sons of the King, viz. <hi>They walk in the light:</hi> upon which there follows two remarkable favours, First an honour, then a Benefit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An Honour, that they are admitted to the Communion of Saints; <hi>They shall have fellowship one with another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A Benefit one of the greatest that may be; Remission. <hi>The blood of Jesus Christ clenseth them from all sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If we say we have fellowship with him; Qui supponit, ponit.</hi> He that supposeth, takes for granted that some such thing there may be. Possible then it is, that there may be such men, who walk in darkness, and yet will not stick to say, that they have fellowship and society with God. And indeed too many there are, who say it. For it hath been an evil which hath always too much troubled the Church, bad no less then good, dissemblers as well as true Believers; nay those especially have boasted of their Society with God and his Son;<note place="margin">Joh. 8.33. Revel. 3.9.</note>
                  <hi>We are of God, we are the children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>we are Jews, when yet they are of the Synagogue of Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vertue is in it self amiable, vice odious. Whence the most wicked would yet seem to be a good man; for should he appear in his own ugly shape, every man would fly from him. The very locusts that came out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless pit, yet appeared like hansom creatures; <hi>they had the faces of men, and hair of women;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 9.7.</note> they would be taken for pieces of beauty, when yet they were dangerous Beasts, Scorpions in the tail, Lions in their teeth. It is one of <hi>Machiavels</hi> Maxims, that, Whether vertue it self be sought for, is not material; yet the appearance is necessary, without which men shall never compass their end. And this Politique of their hellish Master his Scholars have followed, taking upon them to be what they are not. A Wolf to be a Lamb in a woollen coat;<note place="margin">Mat. 7.15. Zach. 13.4. 2 Cor. 11.14.</note> and a Lyar to be a Prophet in a rough garment; an Oppressor to be a Saint, and a Devil to be Angel of light; One that hath nothing to do with the society of Christ, yet to be in it, and of it, that he may deceive. Let but his <hi>Dixit,</hi> his word be taken for it, and affirm he will that he is a cheif of the company. Well then that you be not couzened with such a Lye, and such a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, from his Tongue look to his feet, and find you shall that <hi>he walks in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> That's the first Note.</p>

                  <p>What darkness Saint <hi>John</hi> means, is not hard to guess: <hi>viz.</hi> Ignorance, love and practice of sin, with Impenitence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As Christ raiseth his Kingdom by light, so doth Satan advance his by this darkness.<note place="margin">Gen. 1.3.</note> In the first Creations God began at the Light: <hi>Fiat Lux:</hi> and in the second Creation he doth the like; opens the eyes, heart, understanding
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:200414:290"/> of those, whose salvation he will promote. Satan on the contrary is careful first to blind his Captives, to deal by them as the <hi>Philistims</hi> by <hi>Sampson,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 16.27.</note> pull out their eyes that they should not know sin to be a work of darkness, nor the wages thereof to be the blackness of darkness. For this would stay their walk, and cause them to turn back their feet. Take heed then of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And much more beware of the effects of ignorance, the love, the practice of sin, and irrepentance;<note place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note> for <hi>an impenitent heart heaps up wrath against the day of wrath.</hi> To this pitch whosoever arrives, out of doubt he is the man that walks in darkness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zanchy</hi> observes rightly upon these words,<note place="margin">Zanch. in loc.</note> that there is a great difference betwixt <hi>esse in tenebris,</hi> and <hi>ambulare in tenebris,</hi> to be in, and to walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. In darkness the best man is: For no man knows what he should, nor no man knows what he would. But a good man will labour to see what he knows not, and to turn back when he discovers his error: Whereas a bad man still walks on his way, as the blind blunders in the dark, presuming that no harm shall happen to him. To <hi>walk</hi> in the Hebrew Dialect is a common expression, whether in the way of vice or vertue, and it signifies a perpetual and constant motion, such as is in a walk for pleasure, or a way for progression. Heed then must be taken, that though we step into the darkness of wickedness, yet we neither make it our walk, or our way, neither take delight in it, nor proceed, nor labour about it. For this is a Note of one who hath no fellowship with God. This our Apostle teacheth in plain terms; <hi>if we say we have fellowship with him, and yet walk in darkness,</hi>

                  <p>We lie in our profession; we do not the Truth in our Manners; There is a doing of the Truth, as well as talking of it; and that man whose life doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to his profession, is but a lying Christian. Which when some of the enemies of the Gospel beheld, in derision they said, <hi>Aut hoc non est Evangelium, aut hi non sunt Christiani,</hi> either this is not the Gospel in which is taught so much goodness, or these are no Christians, in whom there is no good at all. You see now, what comes of walking in darkness, in affected and wilful ignorance, in wilful and obstinate rebellion; it thrusts a man out of the Communion of Saints and convinceth him of a grand lye.</p>
                  <p>There is not so great Lyar, as a profane Christian; for he lyes to God, he lyes to Christ, he lyes to man, and he lyes to himself.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To God he lyes first; for he promised him, when he became his, to forsake all works of darkness, when yet he walks in them: He cals himself Gods child, when he carrieth the image of Satan, as if it were possible for God to beget children to another image.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

The lye of the tongue is nothing so dangerous as that of the life. For let the walk be as it will, where the feet wander after impiety, there is a real abrenunciation of the Faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He lyes to man; for man seeing his outward Communion in the Word and Sacraments, in charity takes him for a friend, a Brother, one of the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Saints, when all the while he is but the Devil in <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle, or like the apparition of a spirit: have but patience, and I will open to you the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:200414:291"/> First, these spirits for a time assume bodies; they seem to eat, to drink, to speak, to do what other men do, but they are not nourished nor thrive by it. So these fair-faced Christians do all the actions of the most sincere; they eat with us at the Lords Table, and drink with us in the same Cup: They talk of the Words of God, they hear, they pray, they read, they preach, but yet they are not nourished, or are ere a whit the better for it; because all's done in shew, nothing in Truth. Again the motion of that body assumed by a Spirit is not Natural, or from an inward essential principle; The Spirit assists it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms it not: Such are all the motions of those who are the <hi>spectra</hi> or puppets of religion. Their eyes are made to rowl, their heads hang down, their lips are made to wag, their breasts to shake, and sigh; and sometimes fear, and sometimes praise, and sometimes policy, and sometimes philosophy, but most often gain, assist, and do the work; when none of these worldly respects give any impulse or assistance, the motion is at an end. For this is another property of assumed bodies, that the Spirits which take them, lay them down at pleasure: so is it also in these counterfeits, they are never religious long, but inconstant and fickle; to day an Anabaptist, the next a shaker. Lastly, what actions so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the spirits perform in these borrowed out-sides, they are only fictions; Such are the actions of these hypocrites, appearances only: An apparence of a fast, a mask of devotion, an Act of prayer, a Scene of Alms, <hi>ad Plaudite usque vivunt;</hi> they present the interlude till the <hi>Plaudite,</hi> and that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing given, the hangings are taken down, and the play is done. Say now, whether such white Angels be not great lyars to men.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To themselves, as the end will shew; they lye abominably; fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they say no harm shall happen to them; they promise to themselves life and happiness however they live; general Grace shall save all, when yet their doom is extant, <hi>Depart from me all ye that work iniquity; for I know you not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truth is but only one, and simple without doubling, but falshood is full of folds: Of true Christians there are but one kind; men who are <hi>re &amp; nomine Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxi,</hi> Orthodox in name and life; and it is to be wish'd, as there is but one Christ, so also there were but one kind of Christians. But besides those hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites I now named, there be other profane people, whom we need not stick to call apparent lyars; for these we know walk in darkness; in this black book are the names of all those who live dissolute lives; fornicators, drunkards, proud, blasphemers, all those, <hi>qui ad palatum applicant religionem, who make their belly their God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.19.</note> Those who live dissolutely, and boast of, and glory in their shame, shall have their names enrolled in the head of this book; and those shall be registred in the foot of it, who take up their Christianity upon the stock of their fore-Fathers, as they do their land; suck it in with their first milk, &amp; never inquire farther into the power and force of it. Would to God there were not just reason for me to make this partition: I had rather to have said, you had been all one, all true, all sincere, all upright men, nor hypocrite, nor profane <hi>Esau</hi> amongst us. But I have done it, to make the Good cautelous; the prophane fearful; which are the two uses of this point.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, since there be so many, who profess Communion with the Saints, and yet walk in the dark, it behoves Christians to be wary and circumspect, lest they be not circumvented, lest they take a vizard for a man, and a Wolf in sheeps clothing for a sheep.<note place="margin">2 Kings 2.15.</note>
                     <hi>Jehu</hi>'s question is fit to be propounded to such as <hi>Jehu</hi> was, before we give him the right hand of fellowship, <hi>Is thy heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 24.5.</note> and that he give some manifest of this, before we admit him to our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. For there be many, <hi>who will come in Christs name and deceive many.</hi> It is not good to wrong any man upon a groundless suspition, neither is it wisdom to wrong our selves by over-easie credulity. The same Spirit that saith <hi>charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:200414:291"/> all things;</hi> saith also, <hi>that a fool believeth all things;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.7. Prov. 14.15.</note> and charity is not foolish; as not prone to be suspicious, so not lightly credulous; that then many lyars and hypocrites may be of this fellowship, 'tis a good caution, <hi>That we be not easie of belief, and give credence to every spirit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 4.1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, And as we ought to be circumspect and wary, that we be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by others; so we ought to be as careful, that we be not deceived by our selves: For there is no flattery so dangerous, as is that of a mans own heart, which is apt to perswade, that a Christians life need not be so pure, so strict, so severe as is call'd for. Hence there be who live profane and unholy lives, and yet take upon them to be good Christians; this is that spiritual whoredom so much complained of by the Prophets, causing <hi>a divorce betwixt God and his people:</hi> For as the case is of her who hath play'd the Harlot, that for it is put from her husband with shame; such is his, who follows his own corrupt heart, and <hi>walks in darkness;</hi> his union with God is quite broken off, so long as he remains such, he hath no fellowship with him.</p>
                  <p>Satan hath two Arms with which he wrestles with man, and labours to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw him; despair &amp; presumption; and if he cannot thrust him down to hell with despair of Mercy, he will labour to mount him to a higher fall by presumption on Mercy. Talk with such a presumptuous soul, and he will be ready to boast, that he is secure of Heaven, that he is a partaker of the Divine Nature, one of the Members of the Holy Society; when indeed this is but <hi>infidelis fiducia,</hi> a confident boldness, not grounded upon Faith, but Arrogance; for can a man <hi>have f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Do but hearken to the voyce of Nature among the Philosophers; among them, they were accounted the best men, who did what they said; for the rest, that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, they taught Philosophy as far as their words might be taken. Such was <hi>Aristippus,</hi> who for his wording only of Philosophy, and practising the Court-manners, was usually stiled <hi>Canis Regius, the Court-dog.</hi> Again, in Nature there is nothing feigned, nothing counterfeit, but every thing is what it seems to be; we know the Nightingale by her Tune, the Crow by his Throat, the Lyon by his Roaring, the Fox by his Barking; so a man may with no great labour know a counterfeit Christian from a true, by his life, and by his works; let his words be never so smooth, if his works correspond not to his words, there can be no congruity; for as in Musick there is the best Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; when there is a right proportion observed betwixt the upper and the lower strings; so also in our Christianity there is the best Musick made, when our manners answer to our profession, and our words keep time and tune with both.</p>
                  <p>Hence our Saviour often condemns these out-side Christians; at <hi>prayer,</hi> he will not that they be <hi>tedious,</hi> and <hi>babble;</hi> at <hi>fasting,</hi>

                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>That you have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darknesse.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, He that will walk in the light, must know the light by which he will walk, for a false may seduce him. To the Law then and the Prophets such a man must go, and learn what light God hath hangd forth therein; there he shall finde what's good, what's acceptable, what pleaseth, what displeaseth. You see then whence to fetch your test, and by it be sure not to make a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial trial, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, make a full search and experiment, and you never shall be mistaken, but be sure to know what work will please him, what he will accept.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which I am sure is a holy and good life; this he expects, this he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which will be much help'd on, when a man hath no commerce, nothing at all to do <hi>with the unfruitful works of darknesse.</hi> A quality to be learned from the Light also, whose property it is to joyne it self, and to commingle its beams with the most impure things; and yet partakes not with their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. So also it cannot be avoided, but the sons of light in their walk will meet with the impurest men, for else they must go out of the world, but in their way they may not be defiled and foul'd with them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.3, 10.</note> they may not communicate with the works of darknesse, from which they shall reap no fruit, except that of death and darknesse, the same that <hi>Adam</hi> did for eating of the forbidden fruit.</p>

                     <pb n="573" facs="tcp:200414:292"/>3. Lastly, light detects and brings into open view the fowlest, the basest things, and by detection brings an odium, an hatred upon them. And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves a Christian to walk in that light, which will detect any action, and show of what nature it is; which if it appear to be foul, he will reprove and condemne it, and labour to make the doer asham'd. Which is done two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either by words, as <hi>Lot</hi> did the Sodomites; <hi>O my friends, do not so wickedly.</hi> Thus Christ commands, <hi>If thy brother sinne against thee, go and tell him his fault betwixt thee and him alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or else by deeds, by a spotlesse life, and a holy conversation, which is of the two the most effectual. For every one, who walks in the light,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.7. Matth. 18.15.</note> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince wicked men in their consciences, and shame them in their ungodly cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. So walk then in the light of holinesse and purity, that vvhen a drunkard sees thee live a sober life, and when a wanton beholds thee to walk chastely, he may be suffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now the high favour and honour that will ensue upon this walking, may not be forgotten; 'tis not long since I insisted at large upon it; howsoever it will not be amisse to rub up your memory a little about it, because our Apostle comes over it again.

                  <p>There will follow upon it a mutual fellowship, a firme league and society; A Society with us, us the Apostles, and the Church of true Saints, and consequently a Society with God and Christ, which he mentioned before <hi>Verse</hi> 3. Similitude of manners as it is a strange motive to beget love and friendship, so also it is a fast bond and tye to continue it. Like will best agree with its like, good men with good, bad with bad. Hence good men are called the friends of God, wicked men his enemyes.<note place="margin">John 15.14. Rom. 5.10.</note> Continue then in holinesse, goodnesse and light, and ye shall be his friends; But if you fall once from this, and walk in darknesse, he estemes you not any of his company, his Society, you are his enemyes. Neither can the Church esteme you of her company, for she is Holy, and all that are truly hers are holy ones, a holy Priesthood. <hi>Ne impii vanè de societate Dei,</hi>

                  <p>Behold then you black Swans, the Dignity, the Honour, <hi>the high calling to which you are called, and walk worthy of it. You were far off,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note>
                     <hi>but now you are brought near; you were strangers, but now are made of the houshold; you were enemies, but now you are reconciled; you were dark, but now are made light; you were aliens, but now are made fellow-Citizens with the Saints.</hi> A new honour calls upon you to be new men, a new condition, new deportment and behaviour. One kinde of life becomes a common man, and another him that is enobled: any him who lives in obscurity and darknesse: but a man reserved and circumspect, that man walks in the light and eyes of all. You are called to honour, you are raised to great dignity, to be friends, to have fellowship with God and Christ, and with his Saints; take care then your life be answerable to your state and condition, and be an evidence to your self, and to the world, that you set a price upon this fellowship. How you can prove that you are of this corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not visible to me, except it be by your walking in the light, and therefore walk worthy of it.</p>
                  <p>Good counsel, perhaps you will say; but who is able to hear and follow it? Not to wander, not to slip and fall, and foul our selves, is an higher perfection
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:200414:293"/> than our nature can attain to. Being men, and carrying this flesh about us, the corruption of which is so well known, and walking in this world, the wayes whereof are so dark and dangerous, we cannot choose but erre and mistake, be the light never so resplendent. And to confesse the truth in <hi>multis omnes,</hi> the best of us one while or other follow a false light; and if any man say to the contrary, our Apostle in the very next verse tels him, not that he is proud, and wants humility, but that he is a lyar and hath no truth in him.</p>
                  <p>Our estate then needs some Scripture that may help us in our walke, and comfort us when in the dark we fall. For if our society with God be broken off, when we cease to walk in the light, our case, God help us, is very lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Behold then a text that offereth Grace, 'tis the comfortablest close that ever ended verse. Call for this light, hunger and thirst after the splendor of it, walk along in the way; by it feele an unfeined desire to put away that very work of darknesse in which sometimes you are involved, and your falls, your failings will not break the knot of amity; a pardon then is purchased and sealed for all with the Sonne of Gods own blood. So saith Saint <hi>John</hi> here,</p>

                  <p>For as for that sin against the Holy Ghost, which is never to be cleansed, those who are of this Society shall never be fouled with it. Into all other they may and do fall; yet so often as they are sensible of their filth, and bemoan themselves for it, and flie penitently to this Lavor, it is at hand ready prepared for them to cleanse them from all sin. From all sin original, and actual; from that of the womb, from that of the way; from the errour, from the slip, from the fall; I go farther, from the vomit, from the wallow after the fall.</p>
                  <p>Find me now if you can such another Bath, any that will cleanse from sin, any that from all sin, to all persons, at all times; this hath, doth, and will do it: Our Apostle speaks in the present Tense; it is not <hi>emundavit,</hi> nor <hi>emundabit,</hi>

                  <head>The APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>First then, we shall do well to take notice of our own pollution, and what we are without Christs blood. A sinners case, how gloriously soever he or she glisters in the eyes of men, being in Gods eye, but as the case of a foul diseased person; and we thereby so taught to conceive of sins, as of foule spots with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or as of such excrements and ill humours within, which pass from us by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.1.</note>
                     <hi>inquimanenta spiritus &amp; carnis,</hi> pollutions which defile both flesh and spirit; and unless they be purged away, there is no entring into the heavenly <hi>Hierusalem;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 21.27.</note> for into that holy City, <hi>no unclean thing shall enter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Next, that you who are of this fellowship, do not think too highly of your selves, even you have your spots and bad humours still; though you <hi>walk in the light,</hi> yet you have your Defects, your Eclipses; even you a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so have need of the blood of Christ to cleanse you: The Apostle tells us in the next words, <hi>That if any man think he hath no sin, he deceives himself.</hi> Being a sinner then, he needs the common receit to purge him, <hi>viz.</hi> the blood of Christ, no less than he who is foulest.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Yet here is a wholsome Bath for a timerous trembling conscience, which when it finds about it an unclean thing, is presently quite cast down, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disheartned, as if fot these blains and blotches the man should for ever be cast out of Gods eye: Raise up thy spirit, O thou dejected soul; it was for thy sake that Christ shed his blood, it was for thee he made a Lavor of it; <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum non nocet, si non placet;</hi> the sin that foules thee, and pleaseth not, shall not hurt thee;<note place="margin">Isa. 1.18.</note>

Read over this Text, and mark it well, and you shall find, that it is thus written, <hi>It cleanseth us; Ʋs,</hi>

                  <p>It is then the divinity of the Father of divinations, that the blood of Christ will cleanse men, though they presume obstinately and wilfully to foule themselves. Our Saviour teacheth another Lesson, <hi>Behold thou art made whole, sin no more; Behold you are washed;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 8.10.</note> upon which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>You are washed, you are cleansed, you are sanctified, you are purified; defile not then your selves with Drunkenness, with Fornication,</hi>

                  <p>True it is, that some are the issue of believing, some of unbelieving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but as untrue, that there is in the first an exemption from original sin,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:200414:296"/> as it is true that the latter are guilty; for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, that this sin is in all alike, nor more, nor less, because <hi>by the offence of one, many were dead</hi> alike,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.14. <hi>August.</hi>

                     <hi>even those who had not sinned after the similitude of Adams trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression;</hi> that is, <hi>propriae voluntatis actu,</hi> by an act of their own will, as did <hi>Adam,</hi> and he means Infants: <hi>All dye,</hi> and therefore no difference betwixt a child of a believer, or an unbeliever; of a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a <hi>Gentile,</hi> in respect of natural corruption: And indeed how was it possible, when the child of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> was unborn at the commission of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, that one should be guilty of the transgression of the Law in Paradise more than the other? If they equally sinned in the loyns of <hi>Adam,</hi> as they did, either then exempt both, or exempt neither; for free the one, and you must free the other. <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> distinction then of children of good and bad parents, to this purpose, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together frivolous.</p>
                  <p>And that he collects from it, is as false, That the children of good men are without sin, confirming his assertion by that of the Apostle, <hi>Your children are holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For holy they are not, as if descended from holy parents, they had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent holiness from the birth; yet holy they may be said to be, because the children of believing parents have this Prerogative above Infidels, that they are born within the pale of the Church, and therefore have a present right and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to those means, whereby the Ordinance of Christ is, that his Church should be sanctified.</p>
                  <p>And this Laver their good Mother the Church bestows upon them, because they are polluted; what do you at the water? why hath there been such care taken to wash little children?

                     <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>are they washed? are they by it sanctified? then it will follow, that the children begotten by them, are not born of blood, and the will of the flesh; but coming from regenerate loyns, are a holy seed.</hi>

That a good man beget a man, is natural; but that he beget a just, a holy man, is no wayes necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, because he begets not a child as he is just, but as he is a meer man: And, since now to the nature of man sin cleaves, it is no wonder, that together with his nature, the corruption is infused into the posterity.</p>
                  <p>This is easie to be seen in <hi>Adam</hi> himself, to him God made a promise of pardon, his faith relying upon <hi>the seed of the woman to break the Serpents head,</hi>

                     <hi>2.</hi> That Concupiscence in the Regenerate is a sin, against the Papists:</head>
                  <p>One of the main Reasons that perswaded the <hi>Romanists,</hi> that the vicious nature of original sin in Regenerate persons, is so far unrooted, that they are not guilty of it, is, because the <hi>Messalians</hi> were by <hi>Theodoret</hi> condemned for Hereticks, in that they thought Baptisme as a Razour to shave away past sins; but that it took not away the root, concupiscence remaining behind: But our Adversaries are partial in relation of the <hi>Messalian</hi> Heresie; they thought indeed Baptisme did not unroot original sin, but they added, that it did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver men from the tyranny of Satan, nor yet conferred grace to the resistance of sin: This last we disclaim; the first part of their assertion hath some truth in it. Now those of <hi>Rome</hi> explain themselves about it one way, and we another.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Romanists</hi> grant, that this original corruption is in all men at their conception; which yet so far by Baptisme is taken away, that it ceaseth to be properly sin; that yet it is so called, they confess, because it is the incentive to sin, being much like Tinder, which though it be not formally fire, yet it is very apt to catch the flame; they liken it also to some hereditary disease, put case the Stone or the Gout, which being received even with the seed from the Progenitours, disaffects the sons body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We agree with them in this, that it remains in our nature after Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme, that also it is a provocation to wickedness: but withall we say, which they deny, that it is a sin, and leaves a blot upon the soul.</p>
                  <p>I know very well that original sin extends farther than concupiscence; yet since <hi>Thomas, Lombard,</hi> and the other School-men speak of both as one, I in this place will not separate them; especially since the distinction of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence will give great light and satisfaction in this controversie: Concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is to be considered three manner of wayes.</p>
                  <p>First, As it is a power and faculty of the soul, by which we are stirred and moved from within, to desire somewhat without; and this power is like the visual faculty of the eye, or the prime ability of the ear, both natural and insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; neither is the motion any more sinful, when it moves the soul to desire any thing lawful, than that of the eye, or the ear are, when they are stirred up to behold their proper object. Concupiscence then in this sense is a natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty inseparable from the soul, and it offends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot, when it desires any thing for quantity or quality as it ought, and in that decent order as it should; the fault is when things transitory and sensitive, are inordinately and overmuch, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and spiritual matters too little desired.</p>
                  <pb n="582" facs="tcp:200414:297"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Concupiscence is taken then for an inordinate motion, deviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.3. Gen. 8.21. Rom. 1.24. Tit. 1.15. Rom. 7.23.</note> or ataxie, either in the minde, or in the heart, or in the will, or in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or in the conscience, making a man rebellious to the Law of God, and solliciting to evil. This in the Scripture is call'd <hi>the law of flesh,</hi> because it is in the flesh as the subject; <hi>the Law of the Members,</hi> because it makes an active rebellion in all parts;<note place="margin">Bonav. in <hi>2.</hi> Sent. dist. <hi>30.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>fomes peccati,</hi> because from this scum all filth of sin is fomented; <hi>languor naturae,</hi> because it infeebles a man to do the good he would, and as he would. This is not so properly Original sin, as it is an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent accompanying Original Sin. For in Original Sin there be two things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Thom.</hi> 1. 2ae <hi>q.</hi> 82. <hi>Art.</hi> 3.</note>The One is a privation of, and a defect in Original righteousness, or as <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> teacheth, an Aversion from good, which is the formal part of it: The other is a pronesse to evil, and a difficulty to do good, which is the Material part thereof. Both these are in Original sin. For as sickness is not only a privation of health, but also an ill affection of the body arising from the distemper of the blood and humours: so also this hereditary stain is not only the want of righteousnfes, but also an exorbitancy and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to iniquity. This last ptoceeding from the former, as the act from the habit.</p>
                  <p>For thirdly, Concupiscence is taken for the effects themselves, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it; blindness in the mind, perversenesse in the will, a tumult in the appetite, the loss of supernatural endowments, and the corruption of those which are natural.</p>
                  <p>To apply this; Let Concupiscence be taken in the first sense, for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection naturally arising from the soul, whereby it is carried to desire its proper object in an orderly way, and we grant it is no sin. But take it in the second and third acceptions, as it provokes to evil, averts from good, and sets us to desire unlawful and forbidden things, and so it is a sin: and the reasons to prove this are very pressing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is it not a breach of the last Commandment? hath God in vain said, <hi>Thou shalt not covet?</hi> In which, that not actual concupiscence is condemned, but original, is evident; because the act was prohibited before in the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; necessary then it is, that in this there be somewhat forbidden, which was not before, except we will make but nine Commandments. Which what it should be except original concupiscence, I see not: to which <hi>Zanchy</hi> adds ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reasons, <hi>Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>thes.</hi> 4?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the confession of the Apostle is plain; for five times he calls it sin in the sixth chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and six times in the seventh, and thrice in the eighth; and were it not truly and properly such, he never would so much for it have lamented in his own person the estate of a regenerate man, detested it,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. Ver. 17, 16, 19, 20, 24.</note> and himself for it. This he confess'd <hi>dwelt in him.</hi> This he confess'd made <hi>him do that which he would not.</hi> Against this <hi>he fought and strugl'd,</hi> but could not be rid of it. For this he judged himself to be a <hi>miserable man.</hi> And is it not then sin? Let any man shew, what more sin is able to do.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Farther yet, that vitious quality which lusts against the spirit, and by lusting tempts, and in tempting allures, and by alluring draws the heart to sin, is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sin it self.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. James 1.14.

                     </note> with that excellent determination of Saint <hi>Augustine; Sicut coecitas cordis &amp;c.</hi> As the blindnesse of the Heart is both a sin, in that by reason of it men believe not in God; and a punishment of sin, by which the proud heart of the sinner is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily punish'd: and the cause of sin, since by it man becomes obstinate, and does that which is evil: So concupiscence against which the Spirit doth struggle, is a sin; because there is in it a disobedience against the Law of the mind; and a punishment of sin it is, it being just, that those who rebel against God, should have within a rebel to rise and rebel against them; and it is a cause of sin, in that wicked men do consent and yield unto it.</p>
                  <p>But at these last words of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> our Adversaries hastily catch, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to make their advantage by them; for say they, the consent indeed is sin, but not till that be had; and to this purpose they cast in those words of Saint <hi>James, Lust when it hath conceiv'd, brings forth sin.</hi> It is not, say they, sin,<note place="margin">Rhem. in Rom. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> till it brings forth, which without consent it will never do.</p>
                  <p>We answer, first that the very conception of sin is a sin, though it have not out consent,<note place="margin">Isodor. de diff. Spir. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>27.</hi>
                     </note> because it is a filthy motion of the soul in the affection of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean lust. Then secondly, that the argument follows not; for one Serpent may bring forth another, and yet that not hinder the first to be a Serpent; and so concupiscence, that conceives and brings forth sin as the mother, may be no less a sin then the daughter. The inference to my understanding were far more strong to the contrary and for us, that since lust brings forth sin, therefore it self is a sin; because the fruit declares the root.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pelagians</hi> then that deny the corruption of Nature, and the Papists who teach that Grace doth so far free us from this corruption, that the contrariety betwixt the flesh and the Spirit, and the proneness to desire inordinately things transitory, sensible, and outward, are not sinful, are by this Text found to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers and Lyars.</p>
                  <p>A third sort there are, who yer go one step farther, and free those who are born of God, from all sin, original and actual. They boast, that they are puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, sanctified, washed; all other men are a sort of impure, unholy creatures; they themselves only exempted from the condition of sinners; which is <hi>ex di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametro</hi> contrary to Saint <hi>Johns</hi> words; for saith he,

                  <p>That they are better then other men, let them bless God for it. I envy not their holiness, but will pray that it may be far greater, and that God would add to it, how much soever it is. But perhaps while in the arrogance of their heart they exalt themselves above other men, they may for this their spiritual pride be far worse in the eye of God. <hi>The Publican that stood afar off,</hi> and <hi>begg'd money,</hi> was dearer unto God, then the insolent <hi>Pharisee:</hi>

For if our affections to sin be not purg'd away in this life, the work one time or other will be committed, even by the most regenerate man; upon which there will follow a guilt, which that it may be removed, our Saviour hath taught us daily to pray, <hi>Forgive us our trespasses.</hi> One reason perhaps, why those pure souls dislike that form.<note place="margin">Matth. 6.12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Sin a man may to be said to have, <hi>propter actum peccati,</hi> because he is a continual and daily actor in sin; for which Saint <hi>John</hi> appoints him Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and upon it comforts him with the blood of Christ, which will cleanse him; and in the next chapter assigns him an Advocate; <hi>If any man sin, we have an Advocate;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In Baptism there is Grace conferr'd for the non-imputation of sin, but not for the non-existence of it: for this cause we say, that God vouchsafeth two blessings in Baptism; Remission of sin, and Mortification. He then remits the guilt of sin, so that the iniquity thereof shall be no more imputed to the condemnation of him that is born again. The guilt that is afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by an actual sin, rhough it needs not a new Laver, yet it needs a new repentance.

The rage then of sin, the dominion and reign is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much abated in the regenerate persons, but nor the root, nor the branches are quite taken away.

                     </note>A skilful Artisan frames a statue of the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> which some mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hand envying the glory of the workman, batters, and bruises, and defaces so much as lies in his power: The workman brings this to the file and the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but when he finds that no art will reduce his Statue to the first lustre, in pieces, he breaks it, and melts it anew, that so it may recover its first beauty: God did thus with man, fram'd him to his own likeness, a goodly creature, which the envy of the devil presently defaced. And God perceiving that no skill or power would ever remove from him the bruises and scars, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from that envious spirit, resolves to bring him into the dust of death, that so his blemishes might not remain for ever, but that they might be by the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of death as it were melted out. and never appear more.</p>
                  <p>Hence you may see, that in the judgment of antiquity, that sin doth so far deface our Nature, that the image of God first impress'd upon us, can never be fully repaired, till we be dissolv'd, and as a statue newly melted.</p>
                  <p>The cracks and blurs in a Statue may be perhaps stopped up, and scoured off, yet to a curious eye they will appear.

                     <hi>Zanchy</hi> hath well observed upon this place, that there is a vast difference betwixt the sins of the Regenerate, and those who are not born again. Both sin, but not both in the same manner. Those he cals <hi>deambulationes,</hi> walks in sin: These, <hi>Lapsus,</hi> slips only.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, the wicked walk in darkness; <hi>their ways be dark and slippery,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 35.6.</note> and yet they voluntarily and freely continue in them. 2. Then they take great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in this walk; sin is no burden to them, but a pleasure; so that the works of darknesse give them great content; according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Men love darkness more than light, because their deeds are evil.</hi> 3. Lastly,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.19.</note> they give not over till they have walkt out their walk, and brought their sin to the <hi>Consummatum est,</hi> to be perfect.<note place="margin">James 2.15.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But with a regenerate man it is quite otherwise. For first, sin may surrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiously and in a cunning way steal upon him in his walk, but he will never give it the right hand of fellowship. The purpose of his Will is always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, fixed as the centre immoveable, that God be King, that his Law be his guide. That he makes his scope, though by the practice of the flesh against the Spirit, <hi>destruit in particulari, quod in generali intentione est constitutum;</hi> He doth that he would not. For secondly, he rejoyceth not in doing evil, but <hi>rejoyceth in the truth.</hi> He finds <hi>sin a burden too heavy for him to bear,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.6. Psal. 38.4.</note> and therefore hates, and is willing to cast it off. A full pleasure he takes not in the Act, and less after; <hi>peccat remurmurante conscientiâ,</hi> his conscience mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs and riseth against that he does, and mutters that it should be done; His heart hath little rest within, comes and goes, and disciplines him, and puts him to pain even when he yields; <hi>displicet sibi quia displicet Deo,</hi> he is displeased with himself because he hath displeased his God. Lastly, having slipt, he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, if possible, or if his hard hap be to take a foul fall, he lies not along, and tumbles in his filth, but rises quickly and goes to his God, and complains of his own heart, and of his enemy. He pours in salt tears to his sweet sin, and pays for his pleasure with brine. And ever after is afraid of sin, as of the plague, he flyes from it <hi>citò, longè, tardè.</hi> His departure from it speedy, his remove far, his return is very slow, or never. He looks to every rub, to every stone, every rock against which he may dash his foot; and goes on his way with fear and trembling. He never awakes this sleepy Lion, nor stirs these dregs in the bottom by some tempting object let in by the ear, or any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement from the eye; knowing well that these provocations will be like <hi>Jacobs</hi> pil'd sticks in the troughs and gutters;<note place="margin">Gen. 30.38, 39.</note> the heart that beholds them with delight, will bring forth no other but speck'd and spotted births:</p>
                  <p>These then are the differences betwixt a good and a bad man about sin.</p>

                  <q>Why God was pleased that sin should remain in regenerate persons.</q>
                  <pb n="586" facs="tcp:200414:299"/>
                  <p>Yea but now some will ask, Could not God have utterly destroy'd sin, root and branch, so that it never should have sent forth a blossom, nor born these sowr and hedge-grapes in the regenerate? Yes, no question he could have unrooted sin as well as have pruned it, but he hath left this root and sap in our nature, and permits it to be free and luxuriant even in his choicest vines, for divers weighty reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is, to take down their pride, and to humble them. Man is too apt to have too high a conceit of his own person, his own wit, power, grace: So that there is not such a dangerous enemy to the soul as spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual pride.<note place="margin">Luke 18.11.</note> The Pharisee because he was a little better, in his own conceit, than the Publican, contemn'd him. That a man therefore might descend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own heart, and know himself, God lets the best of his servants be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to this poyson and the effects of ir, and so makes sin a remedy to slay pride, that invincible Monster which otherwise would slay the soul. Saint <hi>Paul for his abundance of Revelations, was in danger to be puffed up;</hi> to asswage this tumour,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12, 7.</note>
                     <hi>there was given to him a thorn in the flesh, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Satan to buffet him.</hi> The heart in the body is so full of heat, it would stifle it self, and us also, were it not that God hath provided the lungs to cool it: Semblably in the soul grace is full of heat and spirit, were it not, that God had ordained these infirmities to cool it, and keep it in temper, to awake our care, and provide that we presume not too high.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, God suffers his servants to have sin about them, and to fall into it, that thereby he may quicken and revive those graces which lie hidden in their hearts;<note place="margin">Acts 5. Joh. 20.28.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is more bold after his denial; <hi>Thomas</hi> more strong in faith, after his infidelity: The good husbandman cuts his Vines, not with a purpose to kill them, but to make them bear more fruit. In the <hi>Canticles,</hi> when Christ left his Spouse,<note place="margin">Cant. 4.4, 5, 6.</note> then <hi>she riseth out of her bed; she opens the door;</hi> then <hi>her hands drop myrrhe upon the Bar;</hi> then <hi>she seeks,</hi> then <hi>she calls for him,</hi> but not before.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.25.</note> No man is crowned, except he strive; and therefore the Lord, who hath prepared for us a Crown, hath also suffered some enemies to remain, that by the battel and conflict with them, our faith, our patience, our perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance might be tryed and increased; no otherwise than the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were left in the Land,<note place="margin">Judg. 2.22.</note>
                     <hi>that his people might thereby be proved, whether they would walk in the way he set them, and keep it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But there is another Reason beyond all these; that is, that by feeling our wants, we may seek for help, and petition for more grace; partly to supply what is wanting, partly to cover what is amiss.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Did not men by experience find how powerful sin is to over-rule them, they would never be so sensible of their own bondage, and sins tyranny; for if the remains only of it in the allay and weakness produce in us so strong and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less remptations and exorbitances, how would it tyrannize, were it in its full strength and vigour? That which abates it, and takes it down, is grace; and grace descends not down upon us, till our prayer ascends up, and fetches it down: Being then, even out of the abatement, sensible of the Tyrannical power, it behoves us to call for help, for armour to resist.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But when we have fought, wrestled, resisted to the utmost, yet we shall be foil'd. A cover then is necessary, that will hide all; and such a one there is; a long white Robe, made of our Saviours righteousness, which is able alone to cover all. He that is truly sensible how much he wants it, will alone petition for it; and it is this same root and stock of sin in the Regenerate, that forceth them to sue for it.<note place="margin">Joh. 16 7.</note> Christ told his Disciples, <hi>it is expedient for you that I go away;</hi> and so it is expedient that Christ sometimes withdraw himself, and leave man in the hands of his own counsels, leave sin in him to provoke, to tempt, to assault, to conquer him: that being pursued, and in danger of undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he may flie to him for remedy.</p>
                  <pb n="587" facs="tcp:200414:299"/>
                  <p>We see it in the common course of life; it is good for some men, that their meat be taken from them, yet meat is the staffe of life; that from some it is good that blood be taken, yet blood is the Nurse of life; that from men with sore eyes light be removed, and yet light is the comfort of life.

This same home-bred, inbred disability will deject a pious soul; this same sad apprehension how little we can do without the help of our good Lord, the sense we have of our fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in his absence, w ll batter a religious heart to a flat nothing; and yet again inflame his affections to grasp his Saviour with all his merits, that he may be <hi>Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption, Light, Life, good works,</hi> in a word, <hi>all in all unto him.</hi>

Wise men love not to be deceived, or if by any, yet not by one they trust, and least of all by him they most trust, the Counsellour that lies in the bosome: But <hi>he who saith he hath no sin, is deceived</hi> by his own heart, his nearest Friend, his dearest Counsellour; of all other Errours then, let us take heed of this: For first, no man will pity us, rather turn upon us the Proverb, <hi>Self-do, Self-have:</hi>

And thither when we come, there we are presented with thy Shadow and Name; but thy Self, in a foul Garment, and deformed face; woe is me, it pities me to see what thou wert, and what thou art.</p>

               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Confession</hi> is an act of a contrite heart, by which he doth acknowledge some offence committed by him, appears to detest it, hate it, and grieves for it; is asham'd for what he hath done, deprecates the due punishment, and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the sin for ever. This is to be done either to God, to the Church, or to our Neighbour; to God daily, either publickly or in private; to the Church, when enjoyned by Authority to remove a scandal; to Man, when our Brother hath ought against us.</p>
               <p>Of that which is to be made to God, our Apostle speaks here especially; to him <hi>to confess,</hi> because <hi>he is to forgive:</hi> He is the searcher of the heart, and knows every sin, and circumstance of it, whether we confess or no; to his eye there is nothing hid, from his ear there is nothing conceal'd; necessary then this acknowledgment cannot be in respect of himself, and yet he calls upon us for this duty, that he might make us pass sentence upon our selves. Before we pass judgment upon a sin, we seem as it were to vote for it, as if good: But to come and ask pardon, is the confession of our errour, of the mistake of our judgment; for by it we condemn the sin, and our selves, that both are naught.</p>
               <p>And that this duty be rightly done, every man must as it were erect a Court in his conscience, and there examine, arraign, accuse, endite, judge, and pass sentence against himself: The grosser sins must be attached, and the lesser not passed by, and of all other the bosome-sin not spared; these must be presented naked and bare, with all the deformity about them, without any extenuation, without any defence: This is to follow the Prophets advice, <hi>Poure out thy heart like water.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 2.19.</note>
                  <hi>Effunde,</hi> Poure it out; it would be fully and amply done, not sparingly, drop after drop; and poured out like water, not like wine, not like oyle; for wine in the Vessel leaves a sent behind it, and oyle a fat and clammy tincture, that will not be gotten out; it would be done as water, when every drop drains out, or quickly dries up, leaving nor taste, nor dregs behind it: But because to make this full confession is impossible; for who knows the Errours of his life? to annex some such form as this to the Enditement, will be a great part of wisdom,<note place="margin">Psal. 19.12.</note>
                  <hi>O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if this Enditement be fully and well drawn, it will extort from the man conscious to his own guilt, shame, sorrow, and anger; shame, that he should be so foul a creature in the eye of a pure God; sorrow, that he should so grosly offend so kind a Father; and anger against himself, that he should be such an ungrateful wretch.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Periit cui periit pudar;</hi> past shame, past grace. He is never like to confess that he hath offended, who is not ashamed of his offence. The true sense of sin, will annihilate, confound, and deject the spirit of a true penitent, and force him to cast his eyes to the ground,<note place="margin">Luke 18.13.</note> and cry, <hi>Lord be merciful:</hi> So it was with <hi>Ezra, Oh my God, I am ashamed and confounded, and blush to lift up my eyes to heaven:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezra 9.4. Dan. 9.7. Jer. 3.3.6.15.8.12.</note> So <hi>Daniel</hi> in his confession, <hi>To us belongs shame and confusion of face:</hi> For faith, however it be confident, yet it is not impudent; that being a Note that the Prophet hath set in the fore-heads of an obstinate and lost people, <hi>That they had a whores fore-head, and could not blush;</hi> and again, <hi>Were they ashamed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="591" facs="tcp:200414:301"/>2. Now shame will bring on contrition and sorrow,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.17. Acts 2.37. &amp; Matth. 3.7.</note> which is the sole sacrifice that God will accept. Prick'd such a man will be to the heart, that he hath so unkindly grieved and provoked so good a God, so compassionate a Father, so gracious a Redeemer, so blessed a Sanctifier. Those threats, and that wrath to come that bring some men to attrition, may begin his sorrow, and soften his heart; but it will be improved farther even into a sorrow for displeasing God, and despising his mercy, and from thence into a real resolution to amend and forsake sin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For with it he will be angry. He will fall out with himself, that he hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out with God. This is that anger which <hi>Solomon</hi> prefers before laughter;<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.2.</note> a holy anger, when a man grows fretful and techy with his sin, and not Gods Law. This indignation the old Penitents expressed by their <hi>Chimarchi in colpa,</hi> as the Italians call it, the beating of their breasts, and crying <hi>mea culpa, meà culpa, mea maxima culpa;</hi> intimating, that if the hand could come at the heart, it would take revenge of it; which because it cannot do, it smites the bosome, the place next it.</p>
               <p>And there is not any affection so essential to Confession as this. Shame hath been, and is in moral men; even the love of vertue, and light of reason will make men blush upon the view of some fore-past error. Sorrow hath also at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended those, at least Attrition, who were not true penitents; <hi>Esau</hi> we finde seeking a blessing with teares; <hi>Ahab</hi> a pardon in sackcloth. But this fretting,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.17. 1 Kings. 21.27.</note> this anger, this indignation of a sinner against his sin, is the truest and most proper signe of true repentance. It pricks the heart, and lets out the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumate-matter of sin that lies there, being never satisfied til it hath taken a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per revenge upon it: Of Luxury and Riot by Abstinence and Fasting: of Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse by a Chaste life; of Oppression by Restitution; of Prophanesse by the practice of Piety; of all disorder by a strict and severe course of life.</p>
               <p>Well now, after the Endictment is fully drawn, and with shame, sorrow and anger confessed, then a true Confessionist must set himself at the Bar, and give sentence against himself, acknowledging what he hath deserved.<note place="margin">Lam. 1.18. Job 42.6. Prov. 30.2. 1 Tim. 1.15. 1 Cor. 15.9. Luke 15.19.</note> That God is righteous; and he and his wayes are wicked; that with <hi>Job</hi> he is vile; with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur,</hi> that he hath not the understanding of a man in him. That with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he is the chief of sinners, the least of the Apostles, the worst of Saints, not worthy to be called a son, and so stand before Gods Tribunal as a guilty person, and begge for a Psalme of mercy.</p>
               <p>For when we have gone over all our faults, and our desert, that's all we have to do, or can do, with strong cries to crave pardon, as the poor prisoner at the Barre, who when the Judge is ready to passe sentence, pleads for favour; which plea yet ought to be deeply serious. The poor man speaks supplications;<note place="margin">Prov. 18.23.</note> and the true penitent being poor in spirit, supplicates; and in his petition the best flowers are eloquent sighs, sobs, groans and cries; <hi>Hoc negotium plus gemiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus quàm verbis agitur.</hi> Some have more words than matter in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; some again more matter than affection; but a true penitent in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is copious, what ever his words be. So was <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.13. Luke 18.13.</note> short in his expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>I have sinned.</hi> The Publican brief, <hi>Lord be merciful,</hi> but they made it out in their affection, and their grief; being very like unto vessels which run not full tap at the first piercing, or flesh that in deeper wounds gusheth not out blood instantly.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have shewed you, what Confession is, and how to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and now I will teach you the necessity of it, by occasion of these words.</p>

                  <p>Saint <hi>John</hi>'s proposition is Conditional. <hi>Si,</hi> If we do it, then the effect
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:200414:302"/> will follow, Remission upon Confession; And the consequence will be as strong in the Negative; If we confesse not, there's no pardon to be expected. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men the case is this; Where the Condition is not perform'd, the party is not bound to grant the favour. In reason it ought to be thus betwixt God and us. The sins which we commit by the breach of Gods Law, are the hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against us,<note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note> which God hath promised to blot out, when we confesse the debt; no reason then we cancel the Bond, if we performe not the Condition. But this being done, pleased he is to engage himself to us, as he is a faithful and a just God, we shall have a pardon. And can there be any stronger reason to enforce the Necessity of Confession? Could this pardon be obtained without it, I would leave you at full liberty, whether you would confesse your sins or no: But since without it, there is no forgivenesse to be had, you must Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> professeth, that nor in silence, nor in roaring he could finde any ease, till he came to confession; But no sooner was he upon his knees, humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing his sins,<note place="margin">Psal, 32.5.</note> but his God was as merciful. <hi>I said I will confesse, and thou forgavest.</hi> In the Courts of men it is otherwise. Confesse, and suffer. Judges then if they finde a Fellon, or a notorious person, try him not to absolve, but to condemne him, especially <hi>si habeant confitentem reum.</hi> But in the Court of heaven it is otherwise; for our good Lord calls upon a wicked man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, not that he may sentence him to death, but that he may passe by his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and pardon him. O the singular and strange ordinance of this kinde and merciful Judge! for that end he desires to draw from the mouths of the guilty a confession, that he may finde no just occasion to take revenge. After Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession among men, there follows condemnation; but here Confession and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification go together. If we confesse, he will forgive.</p>
                  <p>Not that this Confession merits Remission; but as it is a necessary Condition to prepare the man for pardon; it dejects him, and casts him down, and so makes him a fit subject for mercy. It is then presumption to snatch at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise before we have performed the Condition. For God deals by his children, as <hi>Joseph</hi> did by his brethren;<note place="margin">Gen. 42.6.</note> he would not at first make himself known to them, but speaks roughly, and threatens the prison. After they were crushed with great straits,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.3.</note> he graciously tells them, <hi>I am Joseph your brother:</hi> So till we be prepared by confession, God will nor make himself nor our pardon known to us, but speaks roughly, and threatens the prison of Hell. But upon the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open our misdemeanours unto him, he will no more refraine himself, than <hi>Joseph</hi> did; say he will to our oppressed consciences, <hi>I am your father, be of good comfort,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 7.48.</note>
                     <hi>you sins are forgiven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a special service, and therefore may not be omitted. <hi>David</hi> after his sin of numbring the people, assumes the title of Gods servant, because he confessed his fault. <hi>Take away, O Lord, the trespasse of thy servant.</hi> What was he a servant, that had so proudly and lately offended his Master? Not a servant in his fault, but a servant in acknowledging his fault. <hi>For I have done exceeding foolishly.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 31.</note> As if he had said, Though I am no servant in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting folly, yet a servant in confessing it to be foolishly done. <hi>Job</hi> also, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many other proofs, that he was Gods servant, reckons this for one, that he had not hid his sin as <hi>Adam.</hi> After <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned, God had pity on him, sought him in the Garden, and called after him; <hi>Adam, ubi es? Where art thou Adam?</hi> 'tis the voice of a merciful God, that was loth to destroy his creature; he call'd to him therefore, that he might blot out that sin by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, which by his transgression he had contracted. But <hi>Adam</hi> gets fig-leaves about him, hides what he can, casts it upon the woman, the woman upon the Serpent. This did not <hi>Job;</hi> he seeks no cover, no excuse for his sin, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the bare truth before his God. He that in the old Law was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:200414:302"/> with the Leprosie, was to have his garment torne, his head bare, his face covered with a cloth, and to cry, <hi>I am unclean, I am unclean.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Levit. 13.</note> Sinne is this Leprosie, every servant is defiled with it; discover it we must, even when we cover our faces for shame, and cry aloud, and complaine, <hi>we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither yet be ashamed to do it. <hi>Non pudet peccare, &amp; poenitere pudet?</hi> 'Tis a shame to sin, never to say, <hi>I have sinned.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> The confessions of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are extant upon record, and they are exemplary, <hi>Davids</hi> especially. A pitiful thing it is, that whereas God hath ordered that shame should accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sin, and boldnesse confession, that the matter should be so diverted, that men should be impudently bold in sinning, and yet asham'd to confesse that they have sinned. They hide, they extenuate, they mince, they daub all over with untempered morter. Shamelesse men, who will not be perswaded to shame themselves, before God put them to shame before the whole world.</p>
                  <p>For be it known to them, Let their sin be hid with all the Art and cunning that may be, yet God will one day produce it with all the circumstances, when, where, with what minde, how oft committed, and so recover his glory, which shamelesse sinners labour to take from him. To sinne, and think to be hid, is exceedingly to dishonour God in his Attributes; but after we have sinned, to fall down and confesse it, is to make him some amends for that dishonour.

                  <p>This they call'd <hi>Exomologesis,</hi> or the Act of penitence, and they would not grant it to any the second time; of which <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s words are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, <hi>Iteranda non est poenitentia.</hi> For they are not to be understood of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance at large, but of this Church-penance.

And hence the distinction of <hi>remissibile,</hi> and <hi>irremissibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le peccatum,</hi> had its rise; for they yet kept that poor soul, whom they would not admit to the indulgence of the Church, from splitting upon the Rock of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, by informing him, that no question upon his confession and contrition he might receive a pardon from God; to him they left him therefore, to him they refer'd him: But the chaste mother (the Church) would grant no further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; yet by her prayers, by her tears she would not cease to intercede for them, that God would give them Repentance.

                     <hi>2.</hi> De confessione auriculari.</head>
                  <p>This publick confession was in process of time turn'd into private; and that sin which was to be confessed in the ear of the Church, was to be told in the ear of the Priest. This course the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> finding advantagious, have retain'd, and enjoyn'd as a necessary point of salvation; and that except it be done, when it may, or otherwise, <hi>in voto,</hi> there can be no Remission; but this Doctrine is injurious many wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When they go about to impose this upon mens consciences as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to salvation, out of the Word of God, which cannot be found in it; for where is it written, Go and open thy sin in the ears of a Priest! The <hi>Romanists</hi> have much streined their wits to find it in the Scriptures; and at last, that they may put off their Errour with the fairer colour, they put us in mind of the people that came to <hi>John, confessing their sins;</hi> but the Text tells us not, whether to <hi>John,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> or to God; or if it were to <hi>John,</hi> yet it was not in his ear, but before the whole company; and then may well be pressed to prove publick confession in notorious and scandalous sins, but it will never bear up Auricular. Lastly, that all those who do desire Baptism, do acknowledge themselves pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Creatures, and stand in need of that Laver: For brevity sake I omit other Texts wrested by them to this purpose; wrested I say, because in the judgment of many (the best learned among them) there is no manifest Authority, either of the Old or New Testament extant, that ever God or Christ command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to confess our sins to a Priest.</p>
                  <p>To make that then an Ordinance of God, which at the highest is but an Order of the Church, is very injurious. Especialiy to impose it upon the conscience with this tyrannical necessity, that there be a particular enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all mortal sins, with all the circumstances which may aggravate it, once at least every year unto the Priest, or else God will not forgive; This is a Doctrine which lays a yoke upon the necks of Christi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns, heavy and impossible. There may be policy in it, and is, but there is no Truth: and much less, when they make it meritorious, and such an act of religion which <hi>ex opere operato</hi> procures remission. Yea, put case, that he who thus confesseth his sin, be brought to it
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:200414:303"/> meerly out of the sense of the ax laid to the root of the tree,<note place="margin">Dr. Ham. pract. Catech.</note> and the wrath to come, and so only is an Attrite person yet by the power of the Priests key, that is, his Absolution, his attrition is turned into contrition. This is a most ridiculous deceit of souls; for the Priest never can make him contrite that is not, or cause God to accept that which he hath said he will not. A conrite heart is only his sacrifice, which this being not, the Priest tels the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent a lye, that God will accept him for his attrition only.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But now let this injunction of necessity, the opinion of merit, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that follows upon it be taken off, together with that necessary enumeration of all mortal sins: Let these abuses, I say, be disclaim'd, and the wisest Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the Reformed Church acknowledge, that confession to a Priest or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Gods Word, may be of singular use and benefit both for instruction, counsel and comfort.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First of great use it may be for instruction, partly in the Faith, partly about our sin. To go to a Lawyers reading, and hear it, serves us not in our worldly doubts: Nor to hear the physick Lecture for the diseases of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; No, no; we call the learned in both sciences to us; we question them in particulars, and have private conference about our state, and estates. If the like course were taken in the business of our souls, great profit would arise from it. Every man is blinded with self-love, which makes him judge that often to be no sin which is, or that to be well done which is not, or at least the sin not to be so great as he is made to believe. In these and the like cases, would he but call to him some learned and pious Pastor, he might find somewhat whereon to settle, either to go on in a good way, or to repent and desist in a bad, and have an apt and fit remedy prescrib'd him. Besides a man is oftentimes through ignorance, negligence, or iniquity of the times, blinded or perverted in many fundamentals of religion; to rectifie which, though books and Sermons are very good helps; yet an information in private, and a retired conference is far more powerful. Then the reasons are more narrowly sifted, and the doubts cleared, which in general applications are either omitted, or but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched. In private then the acknowledgement of a mans own weakness to a knowing and judicious Physician of thy soul may be an excellent means to stay thee, tht; thou stagger not in the faith. To what purpose else are these words, <hi>The Priests lips shall preserve knowledge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 2.7.</note>
                     <hi>and thou shalt require the Law at his mouth!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again of great use this may be for counsel; Advises in general are but as general prescriptions in Physick; they have not that effect that particular doses have. The Quantities or Ingredients must be varied according to the particular constitution, or condition of the party. The same variety there is of diseased souls; and in general only we can prescribe, till we are acquainted with this or that mans imperfection. Then we can take away, or add to the dose, as we see occasion. It were then a wise way, when thou findst thy soul diseased, to go to some approved and experienced Doctor, and to ask his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel how to be cured of those sicknesses of soul, to which thou art inclined. Behold how <hi>John Baptist</hi> the penitentiary,<note place="margin">Luke 3.10, 11, &amp;c.</note> applyes the parts of his Sermon of repentance to every penitent that came to him; they had all their several an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wers. To the people, who asked, <hi>What shall we do?</hi> he returns answer, <hi>He that hath two coats, let him part to him that hath none.</hi> To the Publicans, who sought <hi>what they should do,</hi> he gives in charge, <hi>Exact n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> more but that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</hi> To the Souldiers, who demanded, <hi>what they were to do?</hi> upon them he laid this apt command, <hi>Do violence to no man, out of fear accuse no man falsly, be content with your wages.</hi> When he had opened to him their necessities, he prescribes apt and fit remedies. One dose served not all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lastly, this private Confession is useful also for Comfort. <hi>God</hi> saith the
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:200414:304"/> Prophet, <hi>hath given me the tongue of the learned, to speak a word in due season. And he that is a good and wise Steward,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 50.4. Luke 12.42.</note>
                     <hi>will give to every one his portion of meat.</hi> Which cannot be so well done, except he know what meat every stomach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. A Pastor may propound the mercies of God in general to repentant sinners, but then they are most cordial, when he declares it to that sin with which a man finds his conscience loaded; and the load he cannot know, till it be made known to him. Then he can turn the key, which Christ hath put into his hand, to the comfort of a poor soul, and say with confidence, <hi>Thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi> That then a penitent may have apt consolation, solid infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and sound advice, wisdom it were to repair to those who are set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, and appointed to give it: And there are as great reasons to perswade it, as that we repair to the learned in the Law, when the Title to our Land is questioned, or that we send for the Physician in any desperate disease. Cases of Conscience, are nice points, and they are to be resolved only by the wise.</p>

                  <head>The CONCLƲSION.</head>
                  <p>To this kind of Confession I shall not farther press you; for I know it is arbitrary. But for the other that which is to be done to God, it may not be omitted. Done it must be, if ever you expect remission. Hence God cals for it, commands it, and exhorts to it. After your shipwrack in sin, he hath left you only this board to swim to shore. Therefore, O thou sinner like to me, nay far better; for I am the cheif of sinners; catch after and lay hold on this plank as a man at sea ready to perish, seizeth on some broken piece of the Ship; for this will bear thee up being almost drown'd in the waves of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and set thee safe on the shore of Gods Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Neither let the difficulty of this Duty deterre thee; unpleasant I know it is to flesh and blood. For if it be a discredit to a man to err, and be deceived, a hard matter it will be to bring a man so far to discredit himself as to confess that he hath err'd, and is deceiv'd. Yet thus it must be, this hard task must be undertaken, the error must be confess'd, the deception acknowledged, and by sorrow retracted; for without it there is no hope of pardon.</p>

                  <p>But how God will have this pardon made known to us, rests in his own breast; for he doth it sometimes immediatly: But the ordinary way to receive it, is from the hand of the Minister,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostles first had it, and their Successours have it also, because those who live in the Church to the end of the World, do as much need remission, as those who liv'd then;<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> and therefore it ought to continue <hi>unto the end of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of which we may not so conceive, as if God absolutely without them cannot bestow a pardon, or that he is bound to this way alone, and cannot work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; for the grace of God is free, and can work, as without the Word, so without Ministers: But if we look to that which is common and ordinary in the course established by him, this is an Ecclesiastical Act, committed, as the rest of the Ministry of Reconciliation, to Ecclesiastical persons: To these, when we testifie our Faith and Repentance, they have power to remit, and what they do, is confirmed by him; for so he hath promised, <hi>Whose sins you remit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 20.23.</note>
                     <hi>they are remitted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note only here this great difference in this power; for the power of God is Absolute, theirs is limited; his is Primitive, theirs derived; his Imperial, theirs only Ministerial. This power being solely invested in God, he might have kept it, without any wrong to any, in himself; but it pleased him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the hands of men, that from them also it might be sought.</p>
                  <p>This little I have said, that the power be not despised, and that men take not themselves to be wiser than God, and chalk to themselves a way of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he never taught. That Faith and Repentance may procure a pardon, I deny not; but that, he, who shall deride, and out of contempt scorn and cast aside this delegated power, I shall not easily believe, that he is endued with these conditions; and therefore may justly doubt whether God out of fidelity and justice is bound to remit his sin: To those who shall submit to his wayes, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don he will grant; for <hi>he is faithful and just.</hi>

                  <p>The sins of all penitent sinners he hath once punished in his Son; from him he received a full price, an ample satisfaction for them; and upon it, was pleased to cancel the Bond,<note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note> and <hi>to blot out the hand-writing against us:</hi> So that now if we confess our sin, and acknowledge the debt, yet truly by faith in Christ plead it to be paid, his justice doth much more embolden us to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Remission, then drive us upon the Rock of diffidence and distrust: For God forbid but <hi>the Judge of all the World should do right.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 18.25.</note> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is a just God, he cannot in justice impute and punish those sins, which were once over and above punished in his Son. <hi>Non factum</hi> then we may not plead; <hi>confiteamur,</hi> stands flat against that; but full payment and satisfaction we

                  <p>There is then in this Attribute great comfort to an afflicted soul; He may at first sight think it makes against him, but being rightly examined, it makes much for him.

                  <p>Consider then the case betwixt the Father and the Sonne, and no man dare call it a free remission; for the purchase was dear, and the price inestimable.

                  <p>Well yet, say some, let it be granted, that it is a pardon of Grace, for those respects before named, yet in regard of some other it cannot. For are not they who receive it, tyed up to hard conditions? must they not confesse? must they not repent? must they not believe? are they not tied in the bonds of new obedience? must they not become new creatures? are they not tied to put off the old man,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.12.

                     </gap>sse and holinesse all the dayes of their lives? without which the pardon can never be obtained, or being obtained, forfeited, and of none effect: Will you call that then a free pardon, which is granted upon such termes?</p>
                  <p>Yes, yes, free enough it is for all this. For I hope when it lay in Gods power, whether he would grant any pardon upon any conditions, that he would grant it upon these, was a gracious offer, and came freely from him, and therefore he might put into it, and binde us, if we would be benefited by it, to what lawes and conditions he pleased. Secondly, These conditions being performed, are not the causes of the pardon, that was freely purchased and freely granted: It was neither for the merit of these, nor yet their worth and dignity that God pardons the sinner. These are only <hi>causae sine quae non,</hi> without which the sinner shall not be pardoned. For God grants not the pardon for these, but freely bestowes it where these are found. A King offers to a poor man who hath offended him, a pardon, and withal tells him, that he will give him Honour and a Crown; only he binds him to confesse his fault, that he trust to him, that he offend him no more, and to perform that, he will give him abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: Will he not acknowledge this to be a gracious and Princely courtesie? Or shall he say, that it was for his own worth and merit that he was thus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and honoured?<note place="margin">Matth. 18.32.</note> The King of heaven deals thus by poor sinners; he forgives the whole debt, <hi>quia rogamus,</hi> because we aske; and he gives a Crown, because we aske. And therefore every where the Scripture attributes this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the meere mercy of God, who freely promised the pardon to the merits of Christ, who freely died to satisfie his justice. Those conditional ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions then, <hi>If you confesse, if you repent, if you beleeve, &amp;c.</hi> rather put us in minde to whom the Remission is granted, then for what it is granted. For even these also are the free gifts of God, and therefore for these, if performed, we cannot deserve it. Now where there is no merit, there the effect must be a meere <hi>Gratuito,</hi> and of mercy.</p>
                  <p>But could not God, without these conditions, have remitted sin? Out of his absolute power he could,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.53.</note> by the same power, that he could command twelve Legions of Angels to his assistance; but he would not do it, because it was not for the honour of his justice, or mercy; it was not compatible with his decree of Election, no nor yet profitable for mankind.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sutable it had not been to his justice; For justice will never endure,
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:200414:307"/> that obstinate, rebellious, contumacious, and impenitent persons receive a pardon. It rather cries aloud, Let such be severely punished. To have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a pardon then to such as wilfully and maliciously go on in wickedness, had been to violate all proceedings of justice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This also had been a great wrong to Grace and Mercy; for is it fit that a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Grace be offered to him that rejects it, and casts it off? which that man doth which is not penitent. For what is it else to say, I will not confess my fault, I will not repent, I will not be a New creature, but in effect, I will none of Gods Grace, I will have no pardon? Besides, Mercy must be a distinct act from justice. But if impenitents should not be punished by justice, but should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a pardon equally with the penitent, what difference could be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt mercy and justice?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This course would clearly overthrow the Decree of Gods Election.<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.5.</note> Chosen some are to life, and in Christ they are chosen, in which decree Faith and Repentance are included. For none are in the number of the redeemed, but such who are tyed to the conditions of Redemption. Promiscuously then to conferr a pardon, is against the nature of Gods election, which made choice of some to life, and expresly set down upon what conditions it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Lastly, this had been to deboist the world, and consequently unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to mankind. For the fear of God had been taken away:<note place="margin">Gen. 20.11.</note> The doors had been opened to all villany, and a flood of wickedness had over-spread the face of the earth. Who would have stood in aw and feared to sin, had he been (whether penitent or no) secure of a pardon. For if our ingeminating in mens ears,<note place="margin">Job 15.16.</note> that there is no pardon to be had by those <hi>who drink iniquity as an Ass drinks water,</hi> that is, with ease, with delight, and yet this will not keep men from sinning against heaven with a high hand: in what ruff, height, impudence shall we conceive would malice have shewed her face, had God ordained a pardon for the impenitent? It was then the goodness and wisdom of God for these causes to enjoyn, <hi>That if we confess our sins, he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,</hi> not else. And here you must give me leave to pause, and wonder, and to cry out with <hi>David, O Lord, who is like unto thee!</hi> Offend but a man,<note place="margin">Psal. 71.19.</note> whose breath is in his nostrils, and tis a marvail, if he grow not implacable, if he rage and swels not as the troubled sea. Will he study, and invent a way of reconciliation? will he admit of any Mediation, or Mediator? Such may be the fury of a mortal soul, that no Messenger or message will be accepted, all offers of peace rejected;<note place="margin">Mat. 18.17.</note> and the man no better thought on then a Heathen or Publican. What a good Lord then do we serve, that though he be offended day after day, yet if we will confess our fault, repent,<note place="margin">Isa. 27.4. Psal. 103.9.</note> return and ask pardon day after day, we shall find it true, that <hi>furor non est illi, he will not keep his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for ever, he will forgive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this purpose he hath exalted his seat of mercy,<note place="margin">Psal. 108.4. Mat. 11.28.</note> and set it above all his works, on which being set, he proclaims, <hi>Come ye all unto me,</hi> and gives us under an oath assurance to come, protesting, <hi>I will not the death of a sinner.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezech. 33.11.</note> Weigh but his ways well, and you shall find this true. Why was it that his Son came down from heaven? why born so meanly? wrapp'd so homely? why was he baptized? why was he tempted? why did he hunger and thirst? why betrayed, arraigned, crucified? why did he bear our iniquities? was it not that we might be freed, discharged, forgiven? Say now that he will not pardon, who would not spare his Son, that he might find a means to pardon.</p>
                  <p>And that for this we might find the greater security, to his Ministers he hath committed the Word of reconciliation; and there is nothing in their Trust, be it either the Word, the Sacraments, their Prayers, the Keys, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neerly relates to Forgivenesse.</p>

Lock out the Pastor doth, and must, but that's not his prime intention; tis with a hope to open the door, and let in again, when he shall see the offendor truly penitent and sorrowful, that gave him just occasion to turn him out, and shut the door upon him.

                     <hi>5.</hi> To cleanse us from all iniquity.</head>
                  <p>It is the Apostles meaning, that there is nor only upon confession a free pardon granted, but there is a purgation that goes along with it, that carries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the malicious filth of sin. The pardon is available for our justification, but the purgation hath an influence upon our lives. By it we come to be new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and are by little and little freed from the pollution of sin. For together with the action of God in forgiving sin concurreth another action of divine Grace,<note place="margin">Whites Orthod. cap. <hi>1.</hi> par. <hi>1.</hi> obs. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> enabling a man to forsake and mortifie every greater sin which God pardoneth. The filthiness of the flesh and spirit is taken down.</p>
                  <p>That we may understand this point the better, and be practitioners in it, know we must that there is a twofold purging: One that is made by the blood of Christ; this is perfect even now; for they to whom the merit of Christ is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, have instantly the Guilt of their sin remitted, so that it hath no power to condemn. The other purging away sin, is by the spirit of Christ, which
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:200414:308"/> will never be brought to perfection, while it works upon this our flesh. For his Spirit begins only this work in this life by the mortification of our earthly members, weakens and subdues the power of sin,<note place="margin">Micah 7.18, 19</note> so that though ir remain in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and act, yet the dominion is removed; for not any one sin raigns in us to command as it was wont to do.</p>
                  <p>Men then do but deceive themselves with hope of a pardon, except they find in themselves the effect of the purgation also. The blood of Christ is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to no man, but by his Spirit; and upon whom the Spirit works, he will be cleansed; so that if after confession a man obstinately and wilfully remains in those foul and enormous sins which he did confess, and lets them reign in him, his pardon is evacuated, and of none effect. For whom the blood of Christ frees from condemnation, his Spirit raiseth and quickneth to Sanctification.</p>
                  <p>I know well, that while we are in this life, we never can be cleansed from frailties and infirmities; in purging, all the noxious humours pass not away at once, but yet there is still a discharge of them, they are lessened, they decay, they flow away still; so it must be in this spiritual putrefaction, although we cannot be rid of it all at once, yet care must be taken, that it be lessened and weakned, purged out as much as may be. <hi>Minimè bonus est, qui m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. And such an effect it will work in the heart of every one that effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally sues it out; for he will thus say to himself, <hi>What shall I sin,</hi>

                  <p>Should a man who is in a great debt, beyond his ability to pay, find his Creditor so merciful as to forgive him all, would he not magnifie his bounty, would he not love him, be thankful to him! God, when the debt was infinite, we bankrupts, that had nothing to pay, freely forgives us; nay, puts into our hands a stock of grace, that we may employ for our advantage; and can we do less than love him for this? This is all he looks for; we can, we may pay it by the assistance of his grace; and shall we then stick with him for, and deny him that, so little?</p>

               <p>VVISE men live by Rules and Precepts; the many by precedents and examples; so generous, so ingenuous, of such heavenly mould are the few; so blind, so vain, of such pliable wax or temper to ill are the most: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> well knowing that in the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> were both, gives in this <hi>Chapter</hi> directions to both, that nor learned, nor unlearned; strong nor weak, should want either Rule or Example to live by. At the third <hi>verse</hi> he gives them a Rule; Not to have any confidence in the flesh; that is, not to hope for salvation by the righteousness that comes by the Law, as they of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, or rather of the concision did, <hi>verse</hi> 2. which Rule he exemplifies in himself, proposeth his priviledges, his exact performances, and yet could not find them gainful for his justification; and therefore in comparison of Christs righteousness, <hi>reckons them as dung, verse</hi> 8. He acknowledgeth his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet withall, shews his contention and endeavour to win the prize: This mind he wishes to be in them, and therefore again at the 17th. <hi>verse,</hi> he proposeth himself, and others for example to walk by; of others not at large; for there were many unruly walkers, <hi>verse</hi> 18, 19. but of those which walk so, as they had <hi>us,</hi> himself, and the other Apostles for an example; <hi>for their Conversation was in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words we have the character of a true Christian, who may well be known by his hope and good behaviour. He is an expectant, and looks for a Saviour; and therefore thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>The fools of this World hold his life madness,</hi> but he knows he takes a wise course; were their expectation like other mens, their Conversation would be like other mens; but they look for a Judge to come from thence; though a Saviour, yet that Saviour to be a Judge, who shall examine all their actions, nay words and thoughts, and this keeps them in awe.</p>

In Heaven they are by their contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, in Heaven by their affections, in Heaven by their wayes and works.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The soul of a good Christian is reposed in Heaven, and therefore he doth alwayes contemplate, and <hi>seek the things above.</hi> His thoughts being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied not about the objects of the eye, but the objects of faith: <hi>He is ever look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not upon the things which are seen, but upon the things which are not seen;</hi>

                  <p>This is a heavenly business, and therefore prosecuted by those only who are bent to Heaven; by this we make use of all good means, fit our selves for all good duties; by this we get more light of true knowledge, more fervour of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, more life of devotion; by this we look strange upon things on earth, and solace and please our selves with invisible comforts; we see our Saviour with <hi>Stephen,</hi> we talk with our God as <hi>Moses,</hi>

                  <p>And because we never can contemplate aright, without sit objects to fix on, therefore hath Christ in his Word proposed to us great mysteries on which to meditate; by reading his Word, and other holy and pious books, we are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to pray, to praise God, to give him thanks, to exalt him with Psalmes and Hymns, and spiritual Songs, in all which while we spend our houres, <hi>Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation</hi> may be well said <hi>to be in Heaven.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. From which when he is escaped, yet he is not safe, for he is in danger of the arrow that fleeth by day: This is the spirit of pride, vain-glory, boasting, presumption, over-much curiosity; and well it is said to flie by day, for it wounds most, when the light of knowledge, or at least so supposed, is in the <hi>Zenith.</hi> They meditate, They contemplate, They spend their time in devotion? What needs that? they have greater matters to search, the secret judgements of God to pry into, to constitute Churches, to gather Saints.

This is the arrow that flies and wounds the heart of many by day, and turns the light into dark night. Of these, those words of <hi>Hosee</hi> may be verified,<note place="margin">Hos. 12.1.</note>

                  <p>Now out of these happy and heavenly contemplations, there ariseth a true
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:200414:313"/> affection, by Divines called <hi>amor unionis,</hi> by which the soul desires to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and joyned to God. For love is that verge and inclination of the soul, by which it joins it self to the object it loves; or to speak more truly, ongeth to be mingled and made one with it. That therefore which gravity and weight is to heavy bodies, that is love to our souls, it moves them forward <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, he did groan for that burden which kept him and his Saviour asunder. Christ was always with <hi>Paul</hi> by the power of his Spirit,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.4.</note> but Paul <hi>desired to be with Christ</hi> to see his glory and partake of it. For as two loving souls, that are kept asunder, are alwayes in perpetual fear and discomfort; <hi>quod ardentius desideres, cares aegrius:</hi> what a man ardently desires, he never wants without trouble: so is it with the soul that truly loves God, it ponders all the impediments that may withold it from God, casts up the dangers that may encounter it in the way, and upon it thinks the time long till it come to appear in the presence of God; it laments, it mourns, it sighs, it weeps, it grieves, till it be fully united to the God of love.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be unknown to you, that Christ in the Scripture is called the Husband of his Church, she then must needs be his Spouse. What affection then every good Woman bears to her Husband, there is no good Wife but knows; she grieves at his departure, fears in his absence, longs for his return; the reason is, because the soul is <hi>ubi amat, non ubi animat,</hi> not where it lives but where it loves. Hence it is, that every good soul who truly bears an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Christ, though in the Word and Sacraments she enjoys many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts from him, yet these give her not full content; she knows that she still is absent from her Lord, and therefore is full of fear, and full of sorrow. Which grief for his absence,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.5.</note> the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles</hi> hath thus expressed; <hi>she sought, and sought, and when she could not find him whom her soul loved,</hi> she fell into a Lipothymie, wanted cordials and spiritual comforts to chear her up; for <hi>she was sick at heart with love,</hi> being overcame with a longing expectation of her future delayed glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Bern. Gerson.</note>And yet observe here, that <hi>languet amor,</hi> she was sick and feeble; it was an infirmity in her, that she could love him no more: Her love though fervent, was not in that degree it should be, being too often cooled by the over-much earthynesse of the neighbouring body: For howsoever her affection stood firm and entire to God, yet she hath too many allurements to draw her downward; sometimes the beauty of the world, sometimes the glittering of riches, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the incentives of pleasure, that I name not the Pandarism of the Devil, make her to entertain many an adulterous thought; so that her best love is but <hi>languor amoris,</hi> weakly dividing it self betwixt God and the world.</p>
                  <p>What then happens to other qualities, the same happens to this of Love; it is either heightned or abated, heated or cooled by certain degrees or steps. There is <hi>Tepor,</hi> there is <hi>fervor</hi> in it. And yet this <hi>Tepor,</hi> this lukewarmness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines rather to fervour, or the utmost degree of heat, than abates to the first of coldness; for it can never be put out, or cool'd by the copious inundation of wickedness; but rather as fire by the aspersion of water, it recovers strength, and breaks out into the greater flame.<note place="margin">Cant. 8.7.</note>
                     <hi>Many waters canot quench love, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the floods drown it;</hi> nor the watery temptations from the flesh; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the raging floods or waves of persecution, are ever able to put out this flame.</p>
                  <p>There is indeed a kind of <hi>Tepor,</hi> verging and inclinable to cold; such was
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:200414:313"/> that <hi>Laodicean</hi> temper, which a little water will quench,<note place="margin">Revel. 3.15.</note> a wicked temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or an easie persecution alters his love. This degree is to be found in an hypocrite, whom you would think to be reaking hot in zeal, as the wind of the time blows up his coal; but all this zeal and courage is dash'd out with the least water that is dash't upon it, or rather goes out of it self. We are not to seek for examples of this kind, <hi>Et si nolim dicere, quis me coget?</hi> When time served,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But there is another <hi>Tepor</hi> or warmth in religion which the godly nourish by prayers, fire by their pious endeavours, and never cease till they make it burn and flame out by their religious works and conversations; for they think it not enough that they be shining, except they be burning Lamps, by which they give an evident testimony of their love, and shew clearly that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is in heaven.</p>

                  <p>Which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> principally in this place professeth in his own, and in the name of the Primitive Christians: For while the Church remained a Virgin, she had the conditions and qualities of a good Maid, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty Sobriety, Chastity.

                  <p n="1">1. It is of great use to instruct us what the lives and behaviour of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians ought to be in this world, <hi>viz.</hi> such, that though <hi>vivant corpore in terra,</hi>

Were it not for his power, we must lie in our graves for ever; were it not for his love, we must rise to condemnation; were it not for his chrisme or unction, we knew not what to answer; well therefore it is for us, that the Judge before whom we must appear, is the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Princes often use to take many Epithits of vanity and arrogance in their titles to themselves, swelling and glorious, but of little use for their people, because they aim more at their own honour, than their Subjects profit: But the honourable titles of our good Prince, <hi>vel sonant Majestatis potentiam, vel pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis gratiam;</hi> either express the power of his Majesty, or the grace of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and that power employed for our good, and that grace appearing in our salvation.</p>
                  <p>Of these powerful and sweet names I shall now say the less, having before been so copious upon them; yet out of those full sheaves, I shall take liberty to collect these few ears, which I will thresh out, and make into several loaves for our present repast.</p>

Objected often indeed it is to this part, that it is fetch't from the earth, that base and lumpish, and heaviest of the Elements; earth and ashes, and dust and clay, being everywhere in the Scripture cast in the face of proud man: But if we would consider that it is the Art of the workman gives esteem and honour to the matter, we could not choose but think that body honourable which was immediatly framed by God: The skill of some curious Artisan, put case <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> or <hi>Polycletes,</hi> frames out of Ivory, or some knotty piece of wood, an Idol

                  <p>Our Body then at the first creation was an honourable piece, frame by Gods own hand, and inspired by his own breath. How then you'le ask,<note place="margin">Oecumen. in loc.</note> came it debased and humbled! <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Zanch. in loc.</note> that the Apostle saith not our humble bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but the body of our humility; for from us this proceeds. The body is from God, but the humility and debasement from our selves. We perish by our own darts, by our own folly. Varieties of diseases, sudden death, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident calamities, banishment, poverty, persecution, prisons: That since that dwels in us, which raiseth the perpetual war betwixt the flesh and the Spirit, all those prostitutions of the body to vile lusts and affections, renders it to be a body <hi>humilitatis nostrae</hi> of our humbling.

                  <p>It is now a Body of sin, and is it then any wonder that it should be a body of humility? Pamper it up with the Tribute of sea and land,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> feed it with the choicest meats, attire it with the entrals of worms, swathe it with the linnen of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and crown it with the buds of roses, yet it is but <hi>vile corpus,</hi> a base and humbled body all this while. Yea for the most part the baser, the more curiously attired, and deliciously fatted: For what do those powdred frizles, and plaistred cheeks, those errant looks, those spots and wanton hair, those new-fangled dresses, and rich jewels? what those <hi>extructae mensae,</hi> that pile of dishes, and variety of sauces, but increase the bodies sin? and look how far sin is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, so far still the body is embased and humbled. They then who go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout most to grace these bodies, may debase them most. The ready way to free them from this vility, is to cease from sin. Every sin that is refrain'd, is a recovery of some part of our prime Nobility. For he grows neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:200414:320"/> to his original beauty, who is most righteous, most holy, most sober, most just.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which when he hath done to the utmost, yet he shall be sure to carry about him too much sin still; and this will never leave, as some evil humour in the body, never I say leave operating, till it make him acknowledge, that his Body is but vile, and hath designed him to corruption. Even <hi>we,</hi> saith the Apostle, we <hi>who have our conversation in heaven,</hi> carry about us but a vile body. The ways of God are wonderful and full of equity. Princes do often command the very houses of rebellious Subjects to be demolished, and some inscription upon an Obelisk to be there engraven, to testifie to posterity their base attempt and treason: And the God of heaven seems to deal thus with his rebel Man; he demolisheth and brings to the Grave the house of his body, and sets this Inscription upon it,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note>
                     <hi>Dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return:</hi> upon which no man can fasten his eye, but he must needs confesse, that he hath but a vile body.</p>
                  <p>But behold the goodness of Almighty God, in the midst of judgement he remembers mercy; of a punishment he makes a remedy, and of poyson a soveraign medicine. He suffered not this body to be base, that it should be embased for ever, but hath ordered that the humility should be a step to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Take a view of the ways and works of God, and you shall find this his course, to give Grace to that which is humble. At the first Creation, his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was to proceed from the more imperfect creatures to the more perfect: Nothing was before something,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> darkness before light, inanimate creatures, the light, the heavens, the elements before the plants and beasts; beasts and plants before Man: And thus it is in his ways of Grace; he brings low before he exalts; to the dust of death, before he sets up. To the body here, we find a promise of Glory, but there is no claim to that, till it hath been in the grave.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. But the other was, that together with the body it should be in conflict before it were crown'd; fast, and pray, and watch, and labour, all which are works of humility, before it could bring the Body its fellow-servant to Glory.</p>

Such an Apology as this of the soul; will be of great force to the Body, that of a vile, humble and ignominious body, it may be made Glorious like Christs: which is the second state in which we are to consider it.</p>

                     <hi>and this corruptible incorruption;</hi> and if Christ by his death, destroyed sin and death, then the life of the Saints must be immortal.

                  <p n="2">2. The second endowment of these glorified bodies, is Beauty,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.18.</note> arising from that splendor, brightness, and clarity that shall be revealed in them. How singular this shall be our Saviour himself declares, when he saith,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.43.</note>

A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and strange thing, that this clod of earth, so thickned and compacted, that it is opacous, should become so light and transparent, as is the most Christal glasse, or clearest Diamond. Of this our Saviour gave us a pattern in the Mount, when <hi>his face did shine as the Sun,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 17.2.</note>
                     <hi>and his rayment was white as the Light.</hi>

                     <pb n="630" facs="tcp:200414:321"/>3. And as these Bodies shall be beautiful, so shall they be impassible also. Those troublesom affections of grief, and fear, or what else here disturb, shall not fall upon glorified Saints. It is true, they have love and joy in their greatest perfections; for they could not be perfect withou them. But look as God is said to love, and hate, and joy, but in a manner far abstracted from humane sense, so do his Saints also in imitation of him, but far from all infirmity and passion.</p>
                  <p>Of affections and passions there is not the same judgement to be given. For some there are of a froward nature, which do pine away and trouble the body, as hunger, and thirst, and diseases, and grief, &amp;c. From these and the like incumbrances the Saints in heaven shall be freed. For they cannot be distempered with heat and cold, nor tormented with hunger and thirst, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with sicknesse and infirmity. <hi>Caro in patria secundum naturam erit, non s cundum desideria passionum:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug.</note> Our flesh is there, but not our desires, and passions; for we can no more be molested, then we can die; But other passions there are, which do rather help and perfect, then hurt, as the information of the senses, as the eye is not offended with a beautiful colour, nor the ear with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and these shall remain in our glorified bodies, because our happiness could not be perfect without them; but yet so ordered and regulated, that the man from them shall receive no prejudice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The next endowment of a glorified body, is Agility, nimblenesse, and quickness, whereby the flesh is freed from all lumpish heavinesse, with which it is now hindered. The body and the parts shall be so subjected to the soul, that <hi>ubi volet Spiritus,</hi>

                  <p>A change there shall be in the qualities, not the substance of the body; such as was in our Saviours body in Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> which was not in the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and proportions, or parts, but in the fashion:<note place="margin">Luke 9.29.</note> and our body at that day shall be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, conformable to that change. The word used by Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Mark</hi> in that transfiguration. The self same corpse that dyed and was dissolved, and laid up either in the womb of the earth, or the maws of wild beasts, or the depth of the Ocean, or any whereelse, shall be set up with the same bones, enlived with the same blood, moved with the same sinews, muscles, arteries, and covered with the same skin. Whatsoever only was imperfect, shall be done away; what was here vile and base, shall be there glorified.</p>
                  <p>Let not then the Philosopher tell me any more of natures ignorance and disability to make a dead man live; for our Christian profession hath taught me that which will make Nature and Death amazed: Nature; that living men should rise out of the dust and ashes scattered and varyed into a thousand forms: Death, that life would be born out of its bowels. And Death and Nature both strucken with amazement, to behold the same man <hi>Virbium,</hi> twice born; first a weakling and an infant, then again firm and perfect; first an heir of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and at last a son of glory.</p>
                  <p>Nor let those wicked off-spring of the old Sadducees, pretend no more the defects or deformities of the body as a colourable argument to scoff down the Truth of the Bodies Resurrection; as if a lame leg, or a blind eye, or a gow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foot, or an infected liver, or putrified lungs, or other imperfections of a diseased man were sufficient allegations to confine the body to an eternal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment.

                     </gap>, that Christ at that day shall make a change, a change like to that of his own body, glorious like his, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect like his; all then which was decayed, imperfect, weak and ruinous, shall be changed into such perfection as may beautifie a glorified body.

<pb n="632" facs="tcp:200414:322"/> which of its own nature is passible, become impassible, because it is manumis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by him.</p>
                  <p>Nay it must be so; for how otherwise should it be restored to its first inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, how to immortality? Is not the contusion or infirmity, or defect to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part, a kind of death to that part? do we not call that a dead hand, which in a palsie is of no use, and dead flesh, that cannot be recovered and made useful? Now if the universal sentence of death over the body be reversed, shall it remain in force upon some part? shall an indulgence be granted to the whole,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.52.</note> and shall any one Member suffer? <hi>The dead shall rise incorruptible,</hi> saith our Apostle, but how incorruptible, if a hand be dead, or the back be bruised, or a foot be full of ulcers? As we must be changed into Glory, so we must be changed from corruption.</p>
                  <p>Again, al the maims of the body are but adventitious and outward casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties; Nature intends them not, God made them not; it was the defects, or excess of the matter, or some outward or inward impressions which caused these exorbitances. An entire body was intended by the first Cause, and so God made man perfect after his own image. <hi>Prius est genus quam casus.</hi> In what perfection then life was bestowed, in the same it shall be restored; <hi>naturae non injuriae reddimur,</hi> we shall be renewed after the model of our first generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not to the pattern of our degeneration; rise we shall as we were first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Adam,</hi> not with those hurts, and wounds, and blows, and defects and deformities which sin hath given us.</p>
                  <p>Further yet, <hi>si non nisi integros Deus suscitat, non suscitat mortuos;</hi> If God shall raise none but entire men, and without defects, he must raise no dead at all. For what man is there lies entire and uncorrupted in his grave, let him die never so entire and complete in every part? What body is there that receives not some maim, when the soul parts from it, when it lies cold, and pale, and wan in the grave! even those embalmed carkasses in the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Pyramids laid up with the greatest cost and care against the teeth and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of time, are not yet so absolute and beautiful, as when the soul enliv'd them. If then the deformities and decayes of the body should hinder its resurrection, it must needs follow that none should arise, when there is not one, which either alive or dead, contracts not deformity.</p>
                  <p>But this is contrary to the Apostle, who saith, <hi>he shall change our vile Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and make it glorious.</hi> Which how could it be done, should it not arise? The soul is indeed Christs Spouse, and the body is cast in for the dowry: <hi>Dot is nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne sequetur animam caro:</hi> He that marries the wife, hath right to the portion, and may call for it. The Body then as the dowry laid up in these receptacles below, shall in good time be called for again, and joyned to the soul, and both together be presented to Christ, never to be divorced either from each other, or from him for ever.</p>
                  <p>And there be these weighty reasons that perswade it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The soul is but the half of man, though the better half. The other half is the Body: so that should Christ be a Saviour of the soul only, and leave the Body in the grave, that great work were done by halfes, and so he should not be a whole Redeemer, which is quite contrary to the order in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e works, who never did any thing but he made it full, perfect, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This out of doubt is the souls desire. These two old friends that live so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years together, do not part without great reluctancy, never but upon as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured promises, and expectation to meet again. The ashes of the dead were not reserved in urns for nothing, nor rheir bodies embalm'd, or their bones carefully laid up to no purpose. It shews that they, for whom this charitable act was done, had a mind this way: One that while he was yet in the body, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:200414:322"/> to be dissolved,</hi> yet in another place corrects or interprets himself thus,<note place="margin">Philip. 1.23.</note>
                     <hi>We that are in this Tabernacle, do groan being burdened: not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon.</hi> And this desire shall not be frustrate;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.4.</note> for God hath decreed that the graves shall open, and Christ hath promised,<note place="margin">Rev. 20.13. Joh. 8.51, 52. <hi>Chrysost.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>That if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man keep his word, he shall not see death for ever, but shall pass from death to life. Moritur ergo, moritur omnis, &amp;c.</hi> Every man, every man dies who is born of a mortal condition; but every man shall live for ever, who is re-born of an immortal seed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Suppose the Body should not rise,<note place="margin">Epiphan. in in Ancor.</note> the sentence of the Judge at the great day might be evacuated; For if the soul should appear alone, it might answer to the accuser of the brethren; The sin charged upon me rose not from me, but from that corruptible and earthly body; that committed the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that stole, slandred, lived intemperately; for since it was separated from me, it cannot be found that I have committed any such thing; An honest Apology, and seasonable to stay the Judges sentence. On the other side, should the Body appear without the soul, it might plead, It is not I sinned, but the soul; for I never committed any villany since it departed, and to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k leave of me. To remove then all excuse and Apology, God hath decreed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn both parts of man, soul and Body together again, and set them before his Tribunal, that they who laboured in the ways of holiness, receive a good reward from him; and they who have wearied themselves in the works of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, be judged accordingly; the body together with the soul,<note place="margin">Wisd. 5.7.</note> and the soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the body.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I add, that this is most agreeable to Gods justice; For shall both parts be co-workers in good and bad, and not both partake in pain and joy? What reason is there that the body should fast, should kneel, do penance, be in want, in torment, in peril, and the soul only rewarded? again the soul draws the body to act her wicked designs, and shall it only be punished?<note place="margin">Tertul. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrect. carnis.</note>
                     <hi>Deum non licet injustum credere Judicem, aut inertem.</hi> But unjust he should seem, if he kept the co-partner in the work from the reward: and neglectful, if he should separate the companion of evil from the deserved punishment. Oh be it far from the Judge of the world, but to do right; far from him to take the work of his own hands, the image of his own body, that part which he hath washed with his holy water and Spirit, and set his own seal in Baptism, which sometime fights for him, sometimes dies for him, and cast it to the worms ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be seen again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly, this argument fetcht from Gods justice, is as powerful for the Identity of the Body: thar must arise the same that was conquered by Death, and no other. The Body with the same eyes, the same lips, the same knees, the same back, the same skin. For what justice were it for one back to be beaten, and another to receive the reward? for one pair of eyes to drop down tears day and night, and another couple of eyes to have the tears wiped from them? Meet it is one would think, that the pay be reserved for that Body, that did the service.

                        </gap>es speak fully and expresly for both. The Body shall rise, and not at large, but indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually.

What here on earth is more esteemed than glory? so precious it is to men of spirit, that it makes them prodigal of their blood. Without doubt thus ambitious were the blessed Martyrs, which made them lay down their lives in the flames! They were assured of the Crowns in heaven, and this made them gain-say the Crowns on earth; they believed the Robes and Scepters, and Thrones, and Palaces above, which so much raised their thoughts, that nor threats, nor blows, nor fire, nor tortures could hinder them from attaining this glory.</p>

Think all this before hand; and since of heaven thou canst not, yet judge of earth as it is worthy; and of what is it worthy, except of thy contempt, except of thy neglect? esteem it as it is, an Inne, which no man yet did equal with a Palace: Hold it but for a Tabernacle, which no man hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>True indeed; but to satisfie the doubt, this word <hi>everlasting</hi> is to be taken in two senses.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Simpliciter, absolute, per se, &amp; suâ naturâ;</hi> and thus God alone is eternal; for being the fountain of life, he must live forever; he is as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the King of all time;</hi> and therefore must raign for all time, having dominion over death; for could death domineer over him, death should be the great God, and not he, who hath not beginning of days, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> yet end of life.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, <hi>everlasting</hi> hath another meaning; that though any thing of its nature being a creature, it may return into that of which it is made, yet by the will of God it nor dies, nor can die; and in this sense everlasting belongs to the soul, and the life it is to live; for if God had so ordained, it might perish with the body, as the soul of other creatures, because the power of God, that made it of nothing, could return it to nothing; but it was his will to have it otherwise, and to make a creature immortal, that in him he might shew his justice and his mercy▪ His justice to the bad; <hi>for they shall go into eternal pain:</hi> His mercy to the good; <hi>for the righteous shall go into eternal life.</hi>

                  <p>Life is the reward, everlasting the Quality of it: now let us consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to whom it belongs, which is not to all promiscuously, but to the Just and Righteous only. <hi>The Righteous shaell go into Everlasting Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Should righteousness be taken for such exact justice that hath no unrighteousnesse admixt with it, such righteous men may not be found, since <hi>in many things we sin all.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">James 3.2.</note> Or should a comparison be made with that justice which is in God, this in a creature may not be expected;<note place="margin">Job. 4.17.</note> for <hi>shall mortal Man be more just then God? shall a man be more pure then his maker?</hi> But let justice and righteousness be examined and measured according to the condition of this life, so all the elect that are destined to eternal life, may in some sense be called Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and just men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note>First and especially for the imputation of Christs Righteousness; for he to them is made justice. Secondly, Because a comparison being made of their lives and actions with the ways and works of the most men, they may well be honoured with the name of Righteous; such was <hi>Noah, Job, Zachary,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> both just before God. Or thirdly, Righteous they may be said to be for their sincerity, being far from all hypocrisie, deceit, and guile. Or lastly, in respect of their works, which are the fruits of their faith informed by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, according to which they shall be judged, (as appears, verses 35, 36.) and for the doing of these accounted and accepted for righteous.</p>
                  <p>It was a question wisely proposed by the young Pharisee, that came to our Saviour;<note place="margin">Mat. 19.16.</note>
                     <hi>Good Master, What shall I do to inherit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life?</hi> that something was to be done, he knew, without which eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life could not be had, and gladly he would know what that was; Now our Saviour sends him and the Lawyer to <hi>Moses;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 10.28.</note>
                     <hi>Do</hi> saith he, <hi>what the Law prescribes, and live.</hi> Not intending thereby that he should obtain Life; for Christ knew that his performance would fall short, but to humble the pride of the young man and the Lawyer, by setting them a task which they must labour to perform, if ever they meant to, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to life. A life lead by the prescript of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, an honest and a godly conversation,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.8.</note>
                     <hi>fruits worthy of Repentance,</hi> must be brought forth by that man, whom God will denominate Righteous. For howsoever we shall not be justified for them, yet God will never reckon us for just and Righteous men without them. Talk no more then of <hi>faith without works;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">James 2.17, 18.</note> for what shall it profit a man, to say he believes in God who is in heaven, when he so leads his life as if there were no God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Is this man, do you think, one of those righteous that shall inherit eternal life? No, no, The life of Grace is the way to the life of Glory.</p>
                  <p>A life of Nature there is, when our soul dwels in this Body, and informs, and enlivens, and moves this earthly burden. A life of Grace there is, when the Spirit of God dwels in the soul, and frees it from the command and dominion of sin. And a life of glory there is, when the Body united to the soul, or the soul alone shall be united to God. The first is common to all, the last proper unto those who in this life shall follow tbe conduct of Grace, and live a righteous, sober, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:200414:328"/> life. For this is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> chain; <hi>Those whom he did fore-know, those he did predestinate to be conformable to the image of his Son; whom he did predestinate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.29, 30.</note>
                     <hi>them he called; whom he called he justified; whom he justified, he glorified.</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified is the last link, Predestination is the first, and that limited by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Christs image; the intervenients are Justification, Vocation: Out of which we may collect, that if we mean to arrive at the life of Glory, by the way we must take heed to our calling, have a care to be assured of our justification; which assurance <hi>quoad nos,</hi> will arise by a life conformable to the image of Gods son. In a word, we must endeavour to serve God in righteousness and true holinesse, which alone can qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et our consciences, and assure men that we are righteous before God.</p>

                  <p>Look not on me who commence this petition, but look upon your own souls for which I commence it, and have pity on them. The benefit will be yours, the life yours, I shall but share with you. Only the greater share I shall have, the more of your souls enter into heaven. T'is my humble suit to God, that they may all come thither: For thither, if they come not, they must go to a worse place: it grieves me to say whither, the torture of that place is so extreme.</p>
                  <p>Surely rhere is a heaven, there is a hell; and as sure there will be a day, when the Judge shall be set, the books opened, sheep and goats appear, and enquiry be made,<note place="margin">Isa. 62.6. Ezech. 33.6, 7.</note> whether we the Watchmen of <hi>Israel</hi> have stood upon our watch, and given you warning, and whether you of the Laity have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be warned. Deceive not your own souls; think not when these words are ended, they shall scatter and vanish in the air, and never be called for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. For the day will come, when for these, and all the rest, an accompt must be made. It will be told you then how the rejection and malediction, the pain and perpetuity of pain, those four Essential parts of hellish torments, were presented at large unto you, and all for no other end, but that <hi>you come not into that place of torment.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 16.28.</note> You will be put in mind then, that a Kingdom, a Crown, a blessing, a life full of joy and honour; honour at Gods right hand, that was durable and lasting, nay everlasting was prepared for you; and yet how much you did undervalue all these for some petty profit or pleasure. The accompt will be strict, the answer I fear me, will be very cold and faulty.</p>
                  <p>That which may be for your advantage, will be, that while you have time,<note place="margin">Wisd, 1.12.

Yet you have Hell before you, tremble you not at the Name! quake you not at the torments? See, the fire burns, the smoak ascends, and the Ghosts roare; The mouth is open, and if you come once within it, there is no getting out, but you shall be burnt, and tortured and tormented for ever.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Den. 1.6.</note>I know your knees are ready to smite together at this report. So many of you then as intend to lead a new life, and to enter your names in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
